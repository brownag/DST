      "definition": "Soils For simplicity in writing definitions of taxa, a distinction is useful between what is a mineral soil and what is an organic soil. The thickness of the horizons that meet the criteria of organic soil materials is used to determine if the soil is classified as an organic soil. If that minimum is not met, the soil is mineral. [see footnote] One exception is the Andisols (defined later). Most Andisols consist of mineral soil materials, but some may be dominated by organic soil materials. Those Andisols that exceed the organic carbon limit defined for mineral soils have a colloidal fraction dominated by short-range-order minerals or aluminum-humus complexes. The properties of these soils are believed to be more strongly affected by the mineral fraction than by the organic fraction. Therefore, the soils are included with the Andisols soil order rather than the organic soils. The minimum thickness used to define an organic soil depends in part on the nature of the materials. A thick layer of sphagnum has a very low bulk density and contains less organic matter than a thinner layer of well-decomposed muck. The definition that follows is intended to classify soils as mineral if both of the following are true: the mineral portion is thick and the organic materials are no thicker than that permitted in the histic epipedon (see chapter 3). The thickness of all organic horizons (O horizons) starting at the soil surface is used to determine the total thickness of organic soil material. This determination is different for buried soils (see chapter 1). An O horizon is considered an organic horizon if it meets the requirements of organic soil material, the plant materials are at least slightly decomposed, and the organic material is neither freshly fallen nor undecomposed plant litter."

The upper boundary of the first horizon, encountered at or below the soil surface that is composed of mineral soil material, is considered the mineral soil surface (note 2). For example, a upland mineral soil with an 5-cm-thick Oi horizon within a horizon sequence of Oi-A-E-Bt-C has two surfaces for depth measurements. There is a soil surface at the boundary between either air or undecomposed plant material and the Oi horizon (at a depth of 0 cm). There is also a mineral soil surface at the boundary between the Oi and A horizons (at a depth of 5 cm). * Twelve percent organic carbon is approximately equal to 20 percent organic matter.

Are 80 percent or more of the volume from the soil surface to a depth of 50 cm or to a glacic layer or a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallowest. It is a general rule that a soil is classified as an organic soil (Histosol or Histel) if more than half of the upper 80 cm (32 inches) of the soil is organic or if organic soil material of any thickness rests on rock or on fragmental material having interstices filled with organic materials. Endnotes 1. Organic carbon content The distinction between organic and mineral soil materials has practical considerations. As the amount of soil organic matter increases, soils tend to absorb more water, have higher cation exchange capacity (CEC), and have a lower bulk density. In addition, soil materials rich in organic matter are subject to loss of organic matter upon disturbance and drainage (due to oxidation) and may subsequently subside appreciably due to volume loss. The criteria used to separate mineral soil materials from organic soil materials has been revised with this edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The revised definition no longer considers soil saturation or clay content and instead uses 12 percent, by weight, soil organic carbon (SOC) as the single point of separation. This change was made for the purpose of simplification and was based on recent literature and analysis of KSSL data from thousands of samples focused on soil organic carbon. Previous definitions considered clay content using a sliding scale and, later, using annual cumulative length of soil saturation. The sliding scale was used as early as the 7th Approximation of Soil Taxonomy (1960). At that time, the sliding scale for organic soil materials was 30 percent organic matter if the horizon had 50 percent clay and 20 percent organic matter if there was no clay. Intermediate clay contents required proportional amounts. Soil saturation was not considered. The same definition was used for identifying O horizons in mineral soils in Soil Taxonomy (1975). Neither the 7th Approximation nor Soil Taxonomy defined O horizons in organic soils. Both indicated that a definition was currently under discussion. From the first edition of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1975) to the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014), a sliding scale was used for separating organic soil materials from mineral soil materials for wet soils (i.e., soils saturated for 30 days or more each year). The scale ranged from12 to 18 percent SOC by weight (roughly 20 to 30 percent organic matter), depending on the clay content. Soils rarely saturated for more than a few days were defined as organic if they contained 20 percent or more SOC by weight. The reasoning for using different criteria for wet soils than for unsaturated soils is not well documented. One justification for the sliding scale was that coarser textured soil materials tend to hold relatively less water and have lower cation exchange capacity compared to soils with higher clay content. Therefore, it requires less organic carbon content to exert a significant influence on soil properties for those soils that are relatively low in clay. Morris et al. (2016) compiled bulk density and soil organic matter data from over 5000 samples and found that at approximately 25 percent soil organic matter (roughly 12 to 13 percent SOC) soil volume becomes a function of soil organic matter content. Analysis of over 3,000 KSSL samples with greater than 12 percent SOC showed no value in using the sliding scale (NCSS, 2018). Statistical analysis of the samples having SOC contents between 12 and 18 percent showed no relationship between bulk density and SOC and no relationship between CEC and SOC.

Mineral soil surface For the purpose of applying Soil Taxonomy, the mineral soil surface is preferred to an organic layer as a starting point for measurement. Organic surface layers are susceptible to volume loss due to oxidation, compaction, fire, or other significant changes after disturbance. The mineral soil surface provides a more stable and durable datum relative to subsurface horizon thickness and depth. Horizons and Characteristics Diagnostic for the Higher Categories This chapter defines the horizons and characteristics of both mineral and organic soils. It is divided into four partshorizons and characteristics diagnostic for mineral soils, characteristics diagnostic for organic soils, horizons and characteristics diagnostic for both mineral and organic soils, and characteristics diagnostic for human-altered and human-transported soils. Table 3-1 shows the diagnostic horizons and characteristics arranged by kinds of material for which they are used. The horizons and characteristics defined below are not in a key format. The \"required characteristics\" for horizons or features, however, are arranged as a key. Some diagnostic horizons are mutually exclusive, and some are not. An umbric epipedon, for example, could not also be a mollic epipedon. A kandic horizon with clay films, however, could also meet the definition of an argillic horizon. The exclusions are stated in the horizon definitions. Horizons and Characteristics Diagnostic for Mineral Soils The criteria for some of the following horizons and characteristics, such as histic and folistic epipedons, can be met in organic soils. They are diagnostic, however, only for the mineral soils."

      "definition": "The Epipedon The epipedon (Gr. epi, over, upon, and pedon, soil) is a horizon that forms at or near the surface and in which most of the rock structure has been destroyed. It is darkened by organic matter or shows evidence of eluviation, or both. Rock structure (fig. 3-1) as used here and in other places in this taxonomy includes fine stratification (5 mm or less thick) in unconsolidated sediments (eolian, alluvial, lacustrine, or marine) and saprolite derived from consolidated rocks in which the unweathered minerals and pseudomorphs of weathered minerals retain their relative positions to each other (note 1). Any horizon may be at the surface of a truncated soil. The following section, however, is concerned with eight diagnostic horizons that have formed at or near the soil surface. These horizons can be covered by a surface mantle of new soil material or a surface mantle of human-transported material, both described in chapter 1. If the surface mantle has rock structure, the top of the epipedon is considered the soil Figure 3-1: Soil profile with rock structure as fine to coarse stratifications throughout. The upper 60 cm is recent eolian sand. The lower part consists of old alluvial deposits interspersed with eolian strata. The soil is a Torriorthent in the United Arab Emirates. Scale is in cm.

If the soil includes a buried soil, the epipedon, if one occurs, is at the soil surface and the epipedon of the buried soil is considered a buried epipedon and is not considered in selecting taxa unless the keys specifically indicate buried horizons, such as those in Thapto-Histic subgroups. A soil with a mantle thick enough to have a buried soil has no epipedon if Table 3-1.

The melanic epipedon (defined below) is unique among epipedons. It commonly forms in deposits of tephra and can receive fresh deposits of volcanic ash. Therefore, this horizon is permitted to have layers within and above the epipedon that are not part of the melanic epipedon. A recent alluvial or eolian deposit that retains fine stratifications (5 mm or less thick) or an Ap horizon directly underlain by such stratified material is not included in the concept of the epipedon because there has not been enough time for soil-forming processes to erase these transient marks of deposition and for diagnostic and accessory properties to develop. An epipedon is not the same as an A horizon. It may include part or all of an illuvial B horizon if the darkening by organic matter extends from the soil surface into or through the B horizon."

The anthropic epipedon consists of mineral soil material that shows evidence of the purposeful alteration of soil properties or of earth-surface features by human activity. The field evidence of alteration is significant and excludes agricultural practices such as shallow plowing or addition of amendments, such as lime or fertilizer.

If the underlying horizon is a B horizon of alteration (defined below as a cambic or oxic horizon) and there is no surface horizon that is appreciably darkened by humus, the lower limit of the ochric epipedon is the lower boundary of the plow layer or an equivalent depth (18 cm) in a soil that has not been plowed. Actually, the same horizon in an unplowed soil may be both part of the epipedon and part of the cambic horizon; the ochric epipedon and the subsurface diagnostic horizons are not all mutually exclusive.

The plaggen epipedon normally shows spade marks at least in its lower part. It may also contain remnants of thin stratified beds of sand that were probably produced on the soil surface by beating rains and were later buried.

It is characterized by a considerable increase in clay content within a very short vertical distance in the zone of contact. In soils that have an abrupt textural change, there normally is no transitional horizon between a mineral epipedon or an eluvial horizon and an argillic, glossic, kandic, or natric horizon, or the transitional horizon is too thin to be sampled. Some soils, however, have a glossic horizon or interfingering of albic materials (defined below) into parts of an argillic, kandic, or natric horizon. The upper boundary of such a horizon is irregular or even discontinuous. Sampling this mixture as a single horizon might create the impression of a relatively thick transitional horizon, whereas the thickness of the actual transition at the contact may be no more than 1 mm (note 69)."

Soils that are in cool, humid climates and have abundant organic carbon, however, may develop andic soil properties without the influence of volcanic glass. A suite of glass and glass-coated minerals rich in silica is termed volcanic glass in this taxonomy. These minerals are relatively soluble and undergo fairly rapid transformation when the soils are moist. Andic soil properties represent a stage in transition where weathering and transformation of primary alumino-silicates (e.g., volcanic glass) have proceeded only to the point of the formation of short-range-order materials, such as allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite, or of metal-humus complexes (note 71). The concept of andic soil properties includes moderately weathered soil material, rich in short-range-order materials or metal-humus complexes, or both, with or without volcanic glass (required characteristic 2) and weakly weathered soil, less rich in short-range-order materials with volcanic glass (required characteristic 3). Relative amounts of allophane, imogolite, ferrihydrite, or metal-humus complexes in the colloidal fraction are inferred from laboratory analyses of aluminum, iron, and silica extracted by ammonium oxalate, and from phosphate retention. Soil scientists may use smeariness or pH in 1N sodium fluoride (NaF) as field indicators of andic soil properties. Volcanic glass content is the percent volcanic glass (by grain count) in the coarse silt and sand (0.02 to 2.0 mm) fraction. Most soil materials with andic soil properties consist of mineral soil materials, but some are organic soil materials with less than 25 percent organic carbon."

      "definition": "The coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE) is a measure describing the proportional change in linear dimension of a soil clod due to shrinking and swelling with changes in moisture content. Higher values indicate greater potential for soil movement (note 73). COLE is calculated as the ratio of the difference between the moist length and dry length of a clod to its dry length. It is (Lm - Ld)/Ld, where Lm is the length at 33 kPa tension and Ld is the length when dry. COLE can be calculated from the differences in bulk density of the clod when moist and when dry. An estimate of COLE can be calculated in the field by measuring the distance between two pins in a clod of undisturbed soil at field capacity and again after the clod has dried. COLE does not apply if the shrinkage is irreversible. Durinodes Durinodes (L. durus, hard, and nodus, knot) are weakly coherent to pedogenically cemented nodules or concretions with a diameter of 1 cm or more. The cement is SiO2 , presumably opal and microcrystalline forms of silica. Durinodes are commonly associated with soils containing volcanic glass as the silica source. They break down in hot concentrated KOH after treatment with HCl to remove carbonates but do not break down with concentrated HCl alone. Dry durinodes do not slake appreciably in water, but prolonged soaking can result in spalling of very thin platelets. Durinodes have a firm or firmer rupture-resistance class and a brittle manner of failure when wet, both before and after treatment with acid. Some durinodes are roughly concentric when viewed in cross section, and concentric stringers of opal are visible under a hand lens."

Aggregates with fragic soil properties show evidence of pedogenesis, including one or more of the following: oriented clay within the matrix or on faces of peds, redoximorphic features within the matrix or on faces of peds, strong or moderate soil structure, or coatings of albic materials or uncoated silt and sand grains on faces of peds or in seams.

If present as coatings, the secondary carbonates cover a significant part of the surfaces. Commonly, they coat all of the surfaces to a thickness of 1 mm or more. If little calcium carbonate is present in the soil, however, the surfaces may be only partially coated. The coatings must be thick enough to be visible when moist. Some horizons are entirely engulfed by carbonates. The color of these horizons is largely determined by the carbonates. The carbonates in these horizons are within the concept of identifiable secondary carbonates. The filaments commonly seen in a dry calcareous horizon are within the meaning of identifiable secondary carbonates if the filaments are thick enough to be visible when the soil is moist.

    "lithologic_discontinuities": {
      "id": "lithologic_discontinuities",
      "term": "Lithologic Discontinuities",
      "definition": "Lithologic discontinuities are significant changes in particle- size distribution or mineralogy that represent differences in lithology within a soil. A lithologic discontinuity can also denote an age difference. For information on using horizon designations for lithologic discontinuities, see the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, pp. 107 109) and chapter 18 of this document. Not everyone agrees on the degree of change required for a lithologic discontinuity. No attempt is made to quantify lithologic discontinuities. The discussion below is meant to serve as a guideline (note 77). Several lines of field evidence can be used to evaluate lithologic discontinuities. In addition to mineralogical and textural differences that may require laboratory studies, certain observations can be made in the field. These include but are not limited to the following: 1. Abrupt textural contacts. An abrupt change in particle-size distribution, which is not solely a change in clay content resulting from pedogenesis, can often be observed. 2. Contrasting sand sizes. Significant changes in sand size can be detected. For example, if material containing mostly medium sand or finer sand abruptly overlies material containing mostly coarse sand and very coarse sand, one can assume that there are two different materials. Although the materials may be of the same mineralogy, the contrasting sand sizes result from differences in energy at the time of deposition by water and/or wind. 3. Bedrock lithology vs. rock fragment lithology in the soil. If a soil with rock fragments overlies a lithic contact, one would expect the rock fragments to have a lithology similar to that of the material below the lithic contact. If many of the rock fragments do not have the same lithology as the underlying bedrock, the soil is not derived completely from the underlying bedrock. 4. Stone lines. The occurrence of a horizontal line of rock fragments in the vertical sequence of a soil indicates that the soil may have developed in more than one kind of parent material. The material above the stone line is most likely transported, and the material below may be of different origin. 5. Inverse distribution of rock fragments. A lithologic discontinuity is commonly indicated by an erratic distribution of rock fragments. The percentage of rock fragments decreases with increasing depth. This line of evidence is useful in areas of soils that have relatively unweathered rock fragments. 6. Rock fragment weathering rinds. Horizons containing rock fragments with no rinds that overlie horizons containing rocks with rinds suggest that the upper material is in part depositional and not related to the lower part in time and perhaps in lithology. 7. Shape of rock fragments. Soil horizons containing angular rock fragments overlying horizons containing well rounded rock fragments may indicate a discontinuity. This line of evidence represents different mechanisms of transport (colluvial vs. alluvial) or even different transport distances. 8. Soil color. Abrupt changes in color that are not the result of pedogenic processes can be used as indicators of discontinuity. 9. Micromorphological features. Marked differences in the size and shape of resistant minerals in one horizon and not in another are indicators of differences in materials. Use of Laboratory Data Discontinuities are not always readily apparent in the field. In these cases laboratory data are necessary. Even with laboratory data, detecting discontinuities may be difficult. The decision is a qualitative or perhaps a partly quantitative judgment. General concepts of lithology as a function of depth might include: 1. Laboratory data - visual scan. The array of laboratory data is assessed in an attempt to determine if a field-designated discontinuity is corroborated and if any data show evidence of a discontinuity not observed in the field. One must sort changes in lithology from changes caused by pedogenic processes. In most cases the quantities of sand and coarser fractions are not altered significantly by soil-forming processes. Therefore, an abrupt change in sand size or sand mineralogy is a clue to lithologic change. Gross soil mineralogy and the resistant mineral suite are other clues. 2. Data on a clay-free basis. A common manipulation in assessing lithologic change is computation of sand and silt separates on a carbonate-free, clay-free basis (percent fraction; e.g., fine sand and very fine sand, divided by percent sand plus silt, times 100). Clay distribution is subject to pedogenic change and may either mask inherited lithologic differences or produce differences that are not inherited from lithology. The numerical array computed on a clay-free basis can be inspected visually or plotted as a function of depth. Another aid used to assess lithologic changes is computation of the ratios of one sand separate to another. The ratios can be computed and examined as a numerical array, or they can be plotted. The ratios work well if sufficient quantities of the two fractions are available. Low quantities magnify changes in ratios, especially if the denominator is low."

It is helpful in predicting whether a soil can be grazed by livestock or can support other loads and in predicting what degree of subsidence would occur after drainage. For mineral soil materials that are not thixotropic (note 78), the n value can be calculated by the following formula: n = (A - 0.2R)/(L + 3H) In this formula, A is the percentage of water in the soil in field condition, calculated on a dry-soil basis; R is the percentage of silt plus sand; L is the percentage of clay; and H is the percentage of organic matter (percent organic carbon multiplied by 1.724). Few data for calculations of the n value are available in the United States, but the critical n value of 0.7 can be approximated closely in the field by a simple test of squeezing a soil sample in the palm of a hand.

      "definition": "A petroferric (Gr. petra, rock, and L. ferrum, iron; implying ironstone) contact (fig. 3-24) is a boundary between soil and a continuous layer of indurated material in which iron is an important cement and organic matter is either absent or present only in traces. The indurated layer must be continuous within the limits of each pedon, but it may be fractured if the average lateral distance between fractures is 10 cm or more. The fact that this ironstone layer contains little or no organic matter distinguishes it from a placic horizon and an indurated spodic horizon (ortstein), both of which contain organic matter. Several features can aid in making the distinction between a lithic contact and a petroferric contact. First, a petroferric contact is roughly horizontal. Second, the material directly below a petroferric contact contains a high amount of iron (normally 30 percent or more Fe2 O3 ). Third, the ironstone sheets below a petroferric contact are thin; their thickness ranges from a few centimeters to very few meters. Sandstone, on the other hand, may be thin or very thick, may be level-bedded or tilted, and may contain only a small percentage of Fe2 O3 . The petroferric contact is generally recognized in some tropical and subtropical areas where layers of ironstone have formed in the soil as sesquioxides accumulated. In the Tropics, the ironstone is generally more or less vesicular."

    "plinthite": {

      "definition": "Plinthite (Gr. plinthos, brick) (fig. 3-25) is an iron-rich, humus-poor mixture of clay with quartz and other minerals. It commonly occurs as dark red redox concentrations that typically form platy, polygonal, or reticulate patterns. Plinthite changes irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan or to Figure 3-24: A soil with a petroferric contact (at a depth of about 80 cm) at the upper boundary between the unconsolidated soil material above and the indurated ironstone sheet below. The soil material below the ironstone is unconsolidated. (Photo courtesy of John Kelley) irregular aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying, especially if it is also exposed to heat from the sun (note 79). The lower boundary of a zone in which plinthite occurs generally is diffuse or gradual, but it may be abrupt at a lithologic discontinuity. Plinthite may occur as a constituent of a number of horizons, such as an epipedon, a cambic horizon, an argillic horizon, an oxic horizon, or a C horizon. It is one form of the material that Figure 3-25: Plinthite (firm, dark red concentrations) in a soil near College Station, Texas. (Photo courtesy of Dr. David Weindorf) has been called laterite. It normally forms in a horizon below the surface, but it may form at the surface in a seep area at the base of a slope. From a genetic viewpoint, plinthite forms by segregation of iron. In many places iron probably has been added from other horizons or from the higher adjacent soils. Generally, plinthite forms in a horizon that is saturated with water for some time during the year. Initially, iron is normally segregated in the form of soft, more or less clayey, red or dark red redox concentrations. These concentrations are not considered plinthite unless there has been enough segregation of iron to permit their irreversible hardening on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. The identification of plinthite in the field is somewhat subjective because an exact definition including measurable properties has not been adopted. Therefore, no \"required characteristics\" are provided. The following discussion provides general guidance for identifying plinthite. Plinthite is firm or very firm when the soil moisture content is near field capacity and hard when the moisture content is below the wilting point. Plinthite occurs as discrete bodies larger than 2 mm that can be separated from the matrix. A moist aggregate of plinthite will withstand moderate rolling between thumb and forefinger and is less than strongly cemented. Moist or air-dried plinthite will not slake when submerged in water, even with gentle agitation. Plinthite does not harden irreversibly as a result of a single cycle of drying and rewetting. After a single drying, it will remoisten and then Figure 3-26: Close-up of slickensides in the lower part of a Vertisol in India. Scale is in cm. can be dispersed in large part if it is shaken in water with a dispersing agent. In a moist soil, plinthite is soft enough to be cut with a spade. After irreversible hardening, it is no longer considered plinthite but becomes ironstone. Indurated ironstone materials can be broken or shattered with a spade but cannot be dispersed if they are shaken in water with a dispersing agent. A small amount of plinthite in the soil does not form a continuous phase; that is, the individual redox concentrations or aggregates are not connected with each other. If a large amount of plinthite is present, it may form a continuous phase. Individual aggregates of plinthite in a continuous phase are interconnected, and the spacing of cracks or zones that roots can enter is 10 cm or more. If a continuous layer is indurated, it becomes a massive ironstone layer that has irregular, somewhat tubular inclusions of yellowish, grayish, or white clayey material. If the layer is exposed, these inclusions may be washed out, leaving an ironstone that has many coarse tubular pores. Much that has been called laterite is included in the meaning of plinthite. Doughy and concretionary laterite that has not hardened is an example. Hardened laterite, whether it is vesicular or pisolitic, is not included in the definition of plinthite."

A densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, if shallower than 130 or 160 cm, constitutes the lower boundary of the control section. In some soils the lower boundary is 25 cm below the upper limit of permafrost. An unconsolidated mineral substratum shallower than those limits does not change the lower boundary of the control section. The control section of Histosols and Histels is divided somewhat arbitrarily into three tierssurface, subsurface, and bottom* . Surface Tier The surface tier of a Histosol or Histel extends from the soil surface to a depth of 60 cm if either (1) the materials within that depth are fibric and three-fourths or more of the fiber volume is derived from Sphagnum or other mosses or (2) the materials have a bulk density of less than 0.1 g/cm3 . Otherwise, the surface tier extends from the soil surface to a depth of 30 cm. Some organic soils have a mineral surface layer less than 40 cm thick as a result of flooding, volcanic eruptions, additions of mineral materials to increase soil strength or reduce the hazard of frost, or other causes. If such a mineral layer is less than 30 cm thick, it constitutes the upper part of the surface tier; if it is 30 to 40 cm thick, it constitutes the whole surface tier and part of the subsurface tier. Subsurface Tier The subsurface tier is normally 60 cm thick. If the control section ends at a shallower depth (at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact or a water layer or in permafrost), however, the subsurface tier extends from the lower boundary of the surface tier to the lower boundary of the control section. It includes any unconsolidated mineral layers that may be present within those depths. Bottom Tier The bottom tier is 40 cm thick unless the control section has its lower boundary at a shallower depth (at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact or a water layer or in permafrost). Thus, if the organic materials are thick, there are two possible thicknesses of the control section, depending on the presence or absence and the thickness of a surface mantle of fibric moss or other organic material that has a low bulk density (less than 0.1 g/cm3 ). If the fibric moss extends to a depth of 60 cm and is the dominant material within this depth (three-fourths or more of the volume), the control section is 160 cm thick. If the fibric moss is thin or absent, the control section extends to a depth of 130 cm. Horizons and Characteristics Diagnostic for Both Mineral and Organic Soils Following are descriptions of the horizons and characteristics that are diagnostic for both mineral and organic soils. Aquic Conditions Soils with aquic (L. aqua, water) conditions are those that currently undergo continuous or periodic saturation and reduction. The presence of these conditions is indicated by redoximorphic features, except in Histosols and Histels, and * The concept of \"tiers\" is used in organic soils because they lack diagnostic horizons as defined for mineral soils. can be verified by measuring saturation and reduction, except in artificially drained soils. Artificial drainage is defined here as the removal of free water from soils having aquic conditions by surface mounding, ditches, or subsurface tiles or the prevention of surface or ground water from reaching the soils by dams, levees, surface pumps, or other means. In these soils, water table levels and/or their duration are changed significantly in connection with specific types of land use. Upon removal of the drainage practices, aquic conditions would return. In the keys, artificially drained soils are included with soils that have aquic conditions. Elements of aquic conditions are as follows (note 85): 1. Saturation is characterized by zero or positive pressure in the soil water* and can generally be determined by observing free water in an unlined auger hole. Problems may arise, however, in clayey soils with peds, where an unlined auger hole may fill with water flowing along faces of peds while the soil matrix is and remains unsaturated (bypass flow). Such free water may incorrectly suggest the presence of a water table, while the actual water table occurs at greater depth. Use of well sealed piezometers or tensiometers is therefore recommended for measuring saturation. Problems may still occur, however, if water runs into piezometer slits near the bottom of the piezometer hole or if tensiometers with slowly reacting manometers are used. The first problem can be overcome by using piezometers with smaller slits and the second by using transducer tensiometry, which reacts faster than manometers. Soils are considered wet if they have pressure heads greater than -1 kPa. Only macropores, such as cracks between peds or channels, are then filled with air, while the soil matrix is usually still saturated. Obviously, exact measurements of the wet state can be obtained only with tensiometers. For operational purposes, the use of piezometers is recommended as a standard method. The duration of saturation required for creating aquic conditions varies, depending on the soil environment, and is not specified. Three types of saturation are defined: a. Endosaturation.The soil is saturated with water in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 200 cm or more from the mineral soil surface, or to a paralithic or lithic contact, whichever is shallower. b. Episaturation.The soil is saturated with water in one or more layers within 200 cm of the mineral soil surface and also has one or more unsaturated layers, with an upper boundary above a depth of 200 cm, below the saturated layer. The zone of saturation, i.e., the water table, is perched on top of a layer with relatively low hydraulic conductivity, including discontinuities, pedogenic horizons, and densic contacts. c. Anthric saturation.This term refers to a special kind of aquic condition that occurs in soils that are cultivated and irrigated (flood irrigation). Soils with anthraquic conditions must meet the requirements for aquic conditions and in addition have both of the following: (1) A tilled surface layer and a directly underlying slowly permeable layer that has, for 3 months or more in normal years, both: (a) Saturation and reduction; and (b) Chroma of 2 or less in the matrix; and (2) A subsurface horizon with one or more of the following: (a) Redox depletions with a color value of 4 or more, moist, and chroma of 2 or less in macropores; or (b) Redox concentrations of iron and/or manganese; or or (c) 2 times or more the amount of iron (extractable by dithionite-citrate) than is contained in the tilled surface layer. 2. The degree of reduction in a soil can be characterized by the direct measurement of redox potentials (note 86). Direct measurements should take into account chemical equilibria as expressed by stability diagrams in standard soil textbooks. Reduction and oxidation processes are also a function of soil pH. Obtaining accurate measurements of the degree of reduction in a soil is difficult. In the context of this taxonomy, however, only a degree of reduction that results in reduced iron is considered, because it produces the visible redoximorphic features that are identified in the keys. A simple field test is available to determine if reduced iron ions are present. A freshly broken surface of a field-wet soil sample is treated with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl in neutral, 1N ammonium acetate solution. The appearance of a strong red color on the freshly broken surface indicates the presence of reduced iron ions (i.e., Fe2+ ). A positive reaction to the alpha,alpha-dipyridyl field test for ferrous iron (Childs, 1981) may be used to confirm the existence of reducing conditions and is especially useful in situations where, despite saturation, normal morphological indicators of such conditions are either absent or obscured (as by the dark colors characteristic of melanic great groups). A negative reaction, however, does not imply that reducing conditions are always absent. It may only mean that the level of free iron in the soil is below the sensitivity limit of the test or that the soil is in an oxidized phase at the time of testing. For soils with very low levels of iron, the use of a field test such as Indicator of Reduction in Soils (IRIS) tubes painted with ferric iron may be warranted in order to document reducing conditions. Use of alpha,alpha-dipyridyl in * This corresponds to the \"satiated, wet\" class (free water present) in the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, p. 209). a 10 percent solution of aceticacid is not recommended because the acid is likely to change soil conditions, for example, by dissolving CaCO3 . The duration of reduction required for creating aquic conditions is not specified. 3. Redoximorphic features (note 87) associated with wetness result from alternating periods of reduction and oxidation of iron and manganese compounds in the soil. Reduction occurs during saturation with water, and oxidation occurs when the soil is not saturated. The reduced iron and manganese ions are mobile and may be transported by water as it moves through the soil. Certain redox patterns occur as a function of the patterns in which the ion-carrying water moves through the soil and as a function of the location of aerated zones in the soil. Redox patterns are also affected by the fact that manganese is reduced more rapidly than iron, while iron oxidizes more rapidly upon aeration. Characteristic color patterns are created by these processes. The reduced iron and manganese ions may be removed from a soil if vertical or lateral fluxes of water occur, in which case there is no iron or manganese precipitation in that soil. Wherever the iron and manganese are oxidized and precipitated, they form either soft masses or hard concretions or nodules. Movement of iron and manganese as a result of redox processes in a soil may result in redoximorphic features that are defined as follows: a. Redox concentrations.These are zones of apparent accumulation of Fe-Mn oxides, including: (1) Nodules and concretions, which are cemented bodies that can be removed from the soil intact. Concretions are distinguished from nodules on the basis of internal organization. A concretion typically has concentric layers that are visible to the naked eye. Nodules do not have visible organized internal structure. Boundaries commonly are diffuse if formed in situ and sharp after pedoturbation. Sharp boundaries may be relict features in some soils. (2) Masses, which are noncemented concentrations of substances within the soil matrix. (3) Pore linings, i.e., zones of accumulation along pores that may be either coatings on pore surfaces or impregnations from the matrix adjacent to the pores. b. Redox depletions.These are zones of low chroma (chromas less than those in the matrix) where either Fe- Mn oxides alone or both Fe-Mn oxides and clay have been stripped out, including: (1) Iron depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of Fe and Mn oxides but have a clay content similar to that of the adjacent matrix (often referred to as albans or neoalbans). (2) Clay depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of Fe, Mn, and clay (often referred to as silt coatings or skeletans). c. Reduced matrix.This is a soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air. In soils that have no visible redoximorphic features, a reaction to an alpha,alpha-dipyridyl (note 88) solution satisfies the requirement for redoximorphic features. Field experience indicates that it is not possible to define a specific set of redoximorphic features that is uniquely characteristic of all of the taxa in one particular category. Therefore, color patterns that are unique to specific taxa are referenced in the keys. Anthraquic conditions are a variant of episaturation and are associated with controlled flooding (for such crops as wetland rice and cranberries), which causes reduction processes in the saturated, puddled surface soil and oxidation of reduced and mobilized iron and manganese in the unsaturated subsoil. Cryoturbation Cryoturbation (frost churning) (fig. 3-28) is the mixing of the soil matrix within the pedon that results in irregular or broken horizons, involutions, accumulation of organic matter on the permafrost table, oriented rock fragments, and silt caps on rock fragments* . Densic Contact A densic (L. densus, thick) contact is a contact between soil and densic materials (defined below). It has no cracks, or the spacing of cracks that roots can enter is 10 cm or more. Densic Materials Densic materials are relatively unaltered materials (do not meet the requirements for any other named diagnostic horizons (note 89) or any other diagnostic soil characteristic) that have a noncoherent rupture-resistance class. The bulk density or the organization is such that roots cannot enter, except in cracks. These are mostly earthy materials, such as till, volcanic mudflows, and some mechanically compacted materials, for example, mine spoil. Some rocks with a noncoherent rupture- resistance class can be considered densic materials if they are dense or resistant enough to keep roots from entering, except in cracks. * Cryoturbation and gelic materials were introduced in the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1998) as a result of the recommendations of the International Committee on Permafrost Affected Soils (ICOMPAS). Figure 3-28: Soil profile from Alaska exhibiting mixing of the surface layer into the subsoil due to cryoturbation. Densic materials slake when an air-dry sample is placed in water and thus differ from paralithic materials and the material below a lithic contact, neither of which slake due to their degree of coherence. Densic materials have, at their upper boundary, a densic contact if they have no cracks or if the spacing of cracks that roots can enter is 10 cm or more. These materials can be used to differentiate soil series if the materials are within the series control section. Gelic Materials Gelic materials are mineral or organic soil materials that show evidence of cryoturbation (frost churning) and/or ice segregation in the active layer (seasonal thaw layer) and/or the upper part of the permafrost. Cryoturbation is manifested by irregular and broken horizons, involutions, accumulation of organic matter on top of and within the permafrost, oriented rock fragments, and silt-enriched layers. The characteristic structures associated with gelic materials include platy, blocky, or granular macrostructures; the structural results of sorting; and orbiculic, conglomeric, banded, or vesicular microfabrics. Ice segregation is manifested by ice lenses, vein ice, segregated ice crystals, and ice wedges. Cryopedogenic processes that lead to gelic materials are driven by the physical volume change of water to ice, moisture migration along a thermal gradient in the frozen system, or thermal contraction of the frozen material by continued rapid cooling. Glacic Layer A glacic layer (fig. 3-29) is massive ice or ground ice in the form of ice lenses or wedges. The layer is 30 cm or more thick and contains 75 percent or more visible ice."

The presence of these conditions is indicated by redoximorphic features, except in Histosols and Histels, and * The concept of \"tiers\" is used in organic soils because they lack diagnostic horizons as defined for mineral soils. can be verified by measuring saturation and reduction, except in artificially drained soils. Artificial drainage is defined here as the removal of free water from soils having aquic conditions by surface mounding, ditches, or subsurface tiles or the prevention of surface or ground water from reaching the soils by dams, levees, surface pumps, or other means. In these soils, water table levels and/or their duration are changed significantly in connection with specific types of land use. Upon removal of the drainage practices, aquic conditions would return. In the keys, artificially drained soils are included with soils that have aquic conditions. Elements of aquic conditions are as follows (note 85): 1. Saturation is characterized by zero or positive pressure in the soil water* and can generally be determined by observing free water in an unlined auger hole. Problems may arise, however, in clayey soils with peds, where an unlined auger hole may fill with water flowing along faces of peds while the soil matrix is and remains unsaturated (bypass flow). Such free water may incorrectly suggest the presence of a water table, while the actual water table occurs at greater depth. Use of well sealed piezometers or tensiometers is therefore recommended for measuring saturation. Problems may still occur, however, if water runs into piezometer slits near the bottom of the piezometer hole or if tensiometers with slowly reacting manometers are used. The first problem can be overcome by using piezometers with smaller slits and the second by using transducer tensiometry, which reacts faster than manometers. Soils are considered wet if they have pressure heads greater than -1 kPa. Only macropores, such as cracks between peds or channels, are then filled with air, while the soil matrix is usually still saturated. Obviously, exact measurements of the wet state can be obtained only with tensiometers. For operational purposes, the use of piezometers is recommended as a standard method. The duration of saturation required for creating aquic conditions varies, depending on the soil environment, and is not specified. Three types of saturation are defined: a. Endosaturation.The soil is saturated with water in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 200 cm or more from the mineral soil surface, or to a paralithic or lithic contact, whichever is shallower. b. Episaturation.The soil is saturated with water in one or more layers within 200 cm of the mineral soil surface and also has one or more unsaturated layers, with an upper boundary above a depth of 200 cm, below the saturated layer. The zone of saturation, i.e., the water table, is perched on top of a layer with relatively low hydraulic conductivity, including discontinuities, pedogenic horizons, and densic contacts. c. Anthric saturation.This term refers to a special kind of aquic condition that occurs in soils that are cultivated and irrigated (flood irrigation). Soils with anthraquic conditions must meet the requirements for aquic conditions and in addition have both of the following: (1) A tilled surface layer and a directly underlying slowly permeable layer that has, for 3 months or more in normal years, both: (a) Saturation and reduction; and (b) Chroma of 2 or less in the matrix; and (2) A subsurface horizon with one or more of the following: (a) Redox depletions with a color value of 4 or more, moist, and chroma of 2 or less in macropores; or (b) Redox concentrations of iron and/or manganese; or or (c) 2 times or more the amount of iron (extractable by dithionite-citrate) than is contained in the tilled surface layer. 2. The degree of reduction in a soil can be characterized by the direct measurement of redox potentials (note 86). Direct measurements should take into account chemical equilibria as expressed by stability diagrams in standard soil textbooks. Reduction and oxidation processes are also a function of soil pH. Obtaining accurate measurements of the degree of reduction in a soil is difficult. In the context of this taxonomy, however, only a degree of reduction that results in reduced iron is considered, because it produces the visible redoximorphic features that are identified in the keys. A simple field test is available to determine if reduced iron ions are present. A freshly broken surface of a field-wet soil sample is treated with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl in neutral, 1N ammonium acetate solution. The appearance of a strong red color on the freshly broken surface indicates the presence of reduced iron ions (i.e., Fe2+ ). A positive reaction to the alpha,alpha-dipyridyl field test for ferrous iron (Childs, 1981) may be used to confirm the existence of reducing conditions and is especially useful in situations where, despite saturation, normal morphological indicators of such conditions are either absent or obscured (as by the dark colors characteristic of melanic great groups). A negative reaction, however, does not imply that reducing conditions are always absent. It may only mean that the level of free iron in the soil is below the sensitivity limit of the test or that the soil is in an oxidized phase at the time of testing. For soils with very low levels of iron, the use of a field test such as Indicator of Reduction in Soils (IRIS) tubes painted with ferric iron may be warranted in order to document reducing conditions. Use of alpha,alpha-dipyridyl in * This corresponds to the \"satiated, wet\" class (free water present) in the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, p. 209). a 10 percent solution of aceticacid is not recommended because the acid is likely to change soil conditions, for example, by dissolving CaCO3 . The duration of reduction required for creating aquic conditions is not specified. 3. Redoximorphic features (note 87) associated with wetness result from alternating periods of reduction and oxidation of iron and manganese compounds in the soil. Reduction occurs during saturation with water, and oxidation occurs when the soil is not saturated. The reduced iron and manganese ions are mobile and may be transported by water as it moves through the soil. Certain redox patterns occur as a function of the patterns in which the ion-carrying water moves through the soil and as a function of the location of aerated zones in the soil. Redox patterns are also affected by the fact that manganese is reduced more rapidly than iron, while iron oxidizes more rapidly upon aeration. Characteristic color patterns are created by these processes. The reduced iron and manganese ions may be removed from a soil if vertical or lateral fluxes of water occur, in which case there is no iron or manganese precipitation in that soil. Wherever the iron and manganese are oxidized and precipitated, they form either soft masses or hard concretions or nodules. Movement of iron and manganese as a result of redox processes in a soil may result in redoximorphic features that are defined as follows: a. Redox concentrations.These are zones of apparent accumulation of Fe-Mn oxides, including: (1) Nodules and concretions, which are cemented bodies that can be removed from the soil intact. Concretions are distinguished from nodules on the basis of internal organization. A concretion typically has concentric layers that are visible to the naked eye. Nodules do not have visible organized internal structure. Boundaries commonly are diffuse if formed in situ and sharp after pedoturbation. Sharp boundaries may be relict features in some soils. (2) Masses, which are noncemented concentrations of substances within the soil matrix. (3) Pore linings, i.e., zones of accumulation along pores that may be either coatings on pore surfaces or impregnations from the matrix adjacent to the pores. b. Redox depletions.These are zones of low chroma (chromas less than those in the matrix) where either Fe- Mn oxides alone or both Fe-Mn oxides and clay have been stripped out, including: (1) Iron depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of Fe and Mn oxides but have a clay content similar to that of the adjacent matrix (often referred to as albans or neoalbans). (2) Clay depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of Fe, Mn, and clay (often referred to as silt coatings or skeletans). c. Reduced matrix.This is a soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air. In soils that have no visible redoximorphic features, a reaction to an alpha,alpha-dipyridyl (note 88) solution satisfies the requirement for redoximorphic features. Field experience indicates that it is not possible to define a specific set of redoximorphic features that is uniquely characteristic of all of the taxa in one particular category. Therefore, color patterns that are unique to specific taxa are referenced in the keys. Anthraquic conditions are a variant of episaturation and are associated with controlled flooding (for such crops as wetland rice and cranberries), which causes reduction processes in the saturated, puddled surface soil and oxidation of reduced and mobilized iron and manganese in the unsaturated subsoil."

Ice segregation is manifested by ice lenses, vein ice, segregated ice crystals, and ice wedges.

Contains many fecal pellets with diameters between a few hundredths of a millimeter and a few millimeters; and 2. Has a color value of 4 or less, moist; and 3.

Diatomaceous Earth A layer of diatomaceous earth is a limnic layer that: 1. If not previously dried, has a matrix color value of 3, 4, or 5, which changes irreversibly on drying as a result of the irreversible shrinkage of organic matter coatings on diatoms (identifiable by microscopic, 440 X, examination of dry samples); and 2. Either yields a saturated sodium-pyrophosphate extract on white chromatographic or filter paper that has a color value of 8 or more and chroma of 2 or less or has a cation-exchange capacity of less than 240 cmol(+) per kg organic matter (measured by loss on ignition), or both. Marl A layer of marl is a limnic layer that: 1. Has a color value of 5 or more, moist; and 2. Reacts with dilute HCl to evolve CO2 . The color of marl usually does not change irreversibly on drying because a layer of marl contains too little organic matter, even before it has been shrunk by drying, to coat the carbonate particles."

Water held at a tension of 1500 kPa or more is not available to keep most mesophytic plants alive. The availability of water is also affected by dissolved salts. If a soil is saturated with water that is too salty to be available to most plants, it is considered salty rather than dry. Consequently, a horizon is considered dry when the moisture tension is 1500 kPa or more and is considered moist if water is held at a tension of less than 1500 kPa but more than zero. A soil may be continuously moist in some or all horizons either throughout the year or for some part of the year. It may be either moist in winter and dry in summer or the reverse. In the Northern Hemisphere, summer refers to June, July, and August and winter refers to December, January, and February. Normal Years In the discussions that follow and throughout the keys, the term \"normal years\" is used. A normal year is defined as a year that has: 1. Annual precipitation that is plus or minus one standard deviation of the long-term (30 years or more) mean annual precipitation; and 2. Mean monthly precipitation that is plus or minus one standard deviation of the long-term monthly precipitation for 8 of the 12 months. For the most part, normal years can be calculated from the mean annual precipitation; however, when catastrophic events occur during a year, the standard deviations of the monthly means should also be calculated. The term \"normal years\" replaces the terms \"most years\" and \"6 out of 10 years,\" which were used in the previous edition of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1975). When precipitation data are evaluated to determine if the criterion for the presence of aquic conditions, or number of days that the moisture control section is moist, or number of days that some part of the soil is saturated has been met, it is permissible to include data from periods with below normal rainfall. Similarly, when precipitation data are evaluated to determine if the criterion for the number of days that the moisture control section is dry has been met, it is permissible to include data from periods with above normal rainfall. It is assumed that if the criteria are met during these periods, they will also be met during normal years (note 90)."

The upper boundary of this control section is the depth to which a dry (tension of more than 1500 kPa, but not air-dry) soil will be moistened by 2.5 cm of water within 24 hours. The lower boundary is the depth to which a dry soil will be moistened by 7.5 cm of water within 48 hours. These depths do not include the depth of moistening along any cracks or animal burrows that are open to the surface. If 7.5 cm of water moistens the soil to a densic, lithic, paralithic, or petroferric contact or to a petrocalcic or petrogypsic horizon or a duripan, the contact or the upper boundary of the cemented horizon constitutes the lower boundary of the soil moisture control section. If a soil is moistened to one of these contacts or horizons by 2.5 cm of water, the soil moisture control section is the boundary of the contact itself. The control section of such a soil is considered moist if the contact or upper boundary of the cemented horizon has a thin film of water. If that upper boundary is dry, the control section is considered dry. The moisture control section of a soil extends approximately (1) from 10 to 30 cm below the soil surface if the particle-size class of the soil is fine-loamy, coarse-silty, fine-silty, or clayey; (2) from 20 to 60 cm if the particle-size class is coarse-loamy; (3) from 30 to 90 cm if the particle-size class is sandy. If the soil contains rock and pararock fragments that do not absorb and release water, the limits of the moisture control section are deeper. The limits of the soil moisture control section are affected not only by the particle-size class but also by differences in soil structure or pore-size distribution or by other factors that influence the movement and retention of water in the soil."

      "definition": "The soil moisture regimes are defined in terms of the level of ground water and in terms of the seasonal presence or absence of water held at a tension of less than 1500 kPa in the moisture control section. It is assumed in the definitions that the soil supports whatever vegetation it is capable of supporting, i.e., crops, grass, or native vegetation, and that the amount of stored moisture is not being increased by irrigation or fallowing. These cultural practices affect the soil moisture conditions as long as they are continued. Aquic soil moisture regime.The aquic (L. aqua, water) soil moisture regime is a reducing regime in a soil that is virtually free of dissolved oxygen because it is saturated by water. Some soils are saturated with water at times while * The Newhall model was designed for this purpose. dissolved oxygen is present, either because the water is moving or because the environment is unfavorable for microorganisms (e.g., if the temperature is less than 1 o C); such a regime is not considered aquic. It is not known how long a soil must be saturated before it is said to have an aquic soil moisture regime, but the duration must be at least a few days, because it is implicit in the concept that dissolved oxygen is virtually absent. Because dissolved oxygen is removed from ground water by respiration of microorganisms, roots, and soil fauna, it is also implicit in the concept that the soil temperature is above biologic zero for some time while the soil is saturated. Biologic zero is defined as 5 o C in this taxonomy. In some of the very cold regions of the world, however, biological activity occurs at temperatures below 5 o C. Very commonly, the level of ground water fluctuates with the seasons; it is highest in the rainy season or in fall, winter, or spring if cold weather virtually stops evapotranspiration. There are soils, however, in which the ground water is always at or very close to the surface. Examples are soils in tidal marshes or in closed, landlocked depressions fed by perennial streams. Such soils are considered to have a peraquic soil moisture regime. Aridic and torric soil moisture regimes.The terms \"aridic\" (L. aridus, dry) and \"torric\" (L. torridus, hot and dry) are used for the same moisture regime but in different categories of the taxonomy. In the aridic (torric) soil moisture regime, the moisture control section is, in normal years: 1. Dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is above 5 o C; and 2. Moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is above 8 o C. Soils that have an aridic (torric) soil moisture regime normally occur in areas of arid climates. A few are in areas of semiarid climates and either have physical properties that keep them dry, such as a crusty surface that virtually precludes the infiltration of water, or are on steep slopes where runoff is high. There is little or no leaching in this soil moisture regime, and soluble salts accumulate in the soils if there is a source. The limits set for soil temperature exclude from these soil moisture regimes soils in the very cold and dry polar regions and in areas at high elevations. Such soils are considered to have anhydrous conditions (defined earlier). Udic soil moisture regime.The udic (L. udus, humid) soil moisture regime is one in which the soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years. If the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 o C and if the mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface differ by 6 o C or more, the soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. In addition, the udic soil moisture regime requires, except for short periods, a three-phase system, solid-liquid-gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 o C. The udic soil moisture regime is common to the soils of humid climates that have well distributed rainfall; have enough rain in summer that the amount of stored moisture plus rainfall is approximately equal to, or exceeds, the amount of evapotranspiration; or have adequate winter rains to recharge the soils and cool, foggy summers, as in coastal areas. Water moves downward through the soils at some time in normal years. In climates where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years, the moisture tension rarely reaches 100 kPa in the soil moisture control section, although there are occasional brief periods when some stored moisture is used. The water moves through the soil in all months when it is not frozen. Such an extremely wet soil moisture regime is called perudic (L. per, throughout in time, and L. udus, humid). In the names of most taxa, the formative element \"ud\" is used to indicate either a udic or a perudic regime; the formative element \"per\" is used in selected taxa. Ustic soil moisture regime.The ustic (L. ustus, burnt; implying dryness) soil moisture regime is intermediate between the aridic regime and the udic regime. Its concept is one of moisture that is limited but is present at a time when conditions are suitable for plant growth. The concept of the ustic soil moisture regime is not applied to soils that have permafrost (defined above). If the mean annual soil temperature is 22 o C or higher or if the mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 o C at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface, the soil moisture control section in areas of the ustic soil moisture regime is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years. It is moist, however, in some part either for more than 180 cumulative days per year or for 90 or more consecutive days. If the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 o C and if the mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by 6 o C or more at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface, the soil moisture control section in areas of the ustic soil moisture regime is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years, but it is not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 5 o C. If in normal years the moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice, the moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. In tropical and subtropical regions that have a monsoon climate with either one or two dry seasons, summer and winter seasons have little meaning. In those regions the soil moisture regime is ustic if there is at least one rainy season of 3 months or more. In temperate regions of subhumid or semiarid climates, the rainy seasons are usually spring and summer or spring and fall, but never winter. Native plants are mostly annuals or plants that have a dormant period while the soil is dry. Xeric soil moisture regime.The xeric (Gr. xeros, dry) soil moisture regime is the typical moisture regime in areas of Mediterranean climates, where winters are moist and cool and summers are warm and dry. The moisture, which falls during the winter, when potential evapotranspiration is at a minimum, is particularly effective for leaching. In areas of a xeric soil moisture regime, the soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. Also, in normal years, the moisture control section is moist in some part for more than half of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is higher than 5 o C or for 90 or more consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 8 o C. The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 o C, and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Soil Temperature Regimes Following is a description of the soil temperature regimes used in defining classes at various categorical levels in this taxonomy. Classes of Soil Temperature Regimes Gelic (L. gelare, to freeze). Soils in this temperature regime have a mean annual soil temperature at or below 0 o (in Gelic suborders and Gelic great groups) or 1 o C or lower (in Gelisols) either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Cryic (Gr. kryos, coldness; indicating very cold soils).Soils in this temperature regime have a mean annual temperature between 0 and 8 o C but do not have permafrost. 1. In mineral soils the mean summer soil temperature (June, July, and August in the Northern Hemisphere and December, January, and February in the Southern Hemisphere) either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower, is as follows (note 91): a. If the soil is not saturated with water during some part of the summer and: (1) If there is no O horizon: between 0 and 15 o C; or (2) If there is an O horizon: between 0 and 8 o C; or b. If the soil is saturated with water during some part of the summer and: (1) If there is no O horizon: between 0 and 13 o C; or (2) If there is an O horizon or a histic epipedon: between 0 and 6 o C. 2. In organic soils the mean annual soil temperature is between 0 and 6 o C. Cryic soils that have an aquic soil moisture regime commonly are churned by frost. Isofrigid soils can also have a cryic soil temperature regime. A few with organic materials in the upper part are exceptions. The concepts of the soil temperature regimes described below are used in defining classes of soils in the lower categories of Soil Taxonomy (i.e., family and soil series). Frigid.A soil with a frigid soil temperature regime is warmer in summer than a soil with a cryic regime, but its mean annual temperature is between 0 and 8 o C and the difference between mean summer (June, July, and August) and mean winter (December, January, and February) soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Mesic.The mean annual soil temperature is 8 o C or higher but lower than 15 o C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Thermic.The mean annual soil temperature is 15 o C or higher but lower than 22 o C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Hyperthermic.The mean annual soil temperature is 22 o or higher, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 o C or more either at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. If the name of a soil temperature regime has the prefix iso, the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 o C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. Isofrigid.The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 8 o C. Isomesic.The mean annual soil temperature is 8 o C or higher but lower than 15 o C. Isothermic.The mean annual soil temperature is 15 o C or higher but lower than 22 o C. Isohyperthermic.The mean annual soil temperature is 22 or o C or higher."

      "id": "sulfidic_materials*",
      "term": "Sulfidic Materials*",
      "definition": "Sulfidic materials contain oxidizable sulfur compounds (elemental S or most commonly sulfide minerals, such as pyrite or iron monosulfides). They are mineral or organic soil materials that have a pH value of more than 3.5 and that become significantly more acid when oxidized. Sulfidic materials accumulate as a soil or sediment that is permanently saturated, generally with brackish water. The sulfates in the water are biologically reduced to sulfides as the materials accumulate. Sulfidic materials most commonly accumulate in coastal marshes near the mouth of rivers that carry noncalcareous sediments, but they may occur in freshwater marshes if there is sulfur in the water. Upland sulfidic materials may have accumulated in a similar manner in the geologic past. If a soil containing sulfidic materials is drained or if sulfidic materials are otherwise exposed to aerobic conditions, the sulfides oxidize and form sulfuric acid. The pH value, which normally is near neutrality before drainage or exposure, may drop below 3. The acid may induce the formation of iron and aluminum sulfates. The iron hydroxysulfate mineral jarosite (fig. 3-31) may segregate, forming the yellow redoximorphic concentrations that commonly characterize a sulfuric horizon. The transition from sulfidic materials to a sulfuric horizon normally requires only a few months and may occur within a few weeks. A sample of sulfidic materials, if air-dried slowly in shade for about 2 months with occasional remoistening, becomes extremely acid."

Pyrite is an iron sulfide mineral that forms as a result of the microbial decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Pyrite forms after iron oxide and sulfate from sea water (or other sources) become reduced to ferrous iron and sulfide, respectively, and then combine to form a very insoluble compound (see description of the sulfidization process given by Fanning and Fanning, 1989, or Fanning et al., 2002). Characteristically, the pyrite crystals occur as nests or framboids composed of bipyramidal crystals of pyrite. In an oxidizing environment, pyrite oxidizes and the products of oxidation (and the hydrolysis of the ferric iron produced) are iron oxides (and under sufficiently acidic and oxidizing conditions, jarosite and/or schwertmannite) and sulfuric acid. The jarosite has a straw-yellow color and frequently lines pores in the soil. Jarosite concentrations are among the indicators of a sulfuric horizon, but jarosite is not present in all sulfuric horizons. The low pH and high amount of soluble sulfates, and/or underlying sulfidic materials, are other indicators of a sulfuric horizon. A quick test of sulfidic materials is a rapid fall in pH on drying or after treatment with an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide. A sulfuric (L. sulfur) horizon forms as a result of drainage (most commonly artificial drainage) and oxidation of sulfide- rich mineral or organic soil materials. It can form in areas where sulfidic materials have been exposed as a result of surface mining, dredging, or other earth-moving operations. A sulfuric horizon is detrimental to most plants and, if sufficiently acid at the soil surface, may prevent plant growth or limit it to certain plant species, such as Phragmites australis, that can tolerate the acidity under certain conditions."

Examples of nonpersistent artifacts repeatedly added to soil to improve agricultural production include biosolids, aglime, quicklime, and synthetic inorganic fertilizers. Humans have also added midden material to the soil to increase agricultural productivity, but these additions (e.g., bones, shells, and cooking waste and associated charred byproducts) have persisted to produce long-term (hundreds to thousands of years) changes in soil properties (e.g., Terra Preta de Indio soils).

    "human_altered_material": {
      "id": "human_altered_material",
      "term": "Human-Altered Material",
      "definition": "Human-altered material is parent material for soil that has undergone anthroturbation (soil mixing or disturbance by humans). It occurs in soils that have either been used for gardening, been deeply mixed in place, excavated, and replaced, or been compacted in place for the artificial ponding of water. Human-altered material may be composed of either organic or mineral soil material. It may contain artifacts (e.g., shells or bones) used as agricultural amendments, but the majority of the material has no evidence that it was transported from outside of the pedon. Human-altered material occurs in soils which are disturbed for various reasons. For example, human-altered material occurs in agricultural soils which are deeply plowed or ripped to disrupt a root-limiting layer (defined in chapter 17) or other physical restriction. Gravesites in cemeteries contain human- altered material as well as artifacts. Densic contacts form at the top of wet, slowly permeable (i.e., puddled) layers when they are compacted by humans, and they destroy structure and impede water percolation. Subsequent artificial ponding in such human-altered material results in anthric saturation (defined above) for the purpose of growing crops like rice in paddy soils. Diagnostic horizons formed by significant illuviation (e.g., argillic or petrocalcic horizons) have not been documented as occurring in human-altered material. However, laterally tracing an illuvial horizon or diagnostic characteristic to find a discontinuity where the horizon or characteristic is abruptly absent can be used to identify human-altered material. The lateral discontinuity typically extends along linear boundaries. When the lateral discontinuity occurs at the edge of an anthropogenic landform or microfeature (defined above), it confirms the destructional origin of the landform or feature and identifies the human-altered material produced through excavation. It is often the preponderance of evidence (best professional judgment) along with published or historical evidence and onsite observations that allows the most consistent identification of excavated human-altered material."

    "human_transported_material": {
      "id": "human_transported_material",
      "term": "Human-Transported Material",
      "definition": "Human-transported material is parent material for soil that has been moved horizontally onto a pedon from a source area outside of that pedon by purposeful human activity, usually with the aid of machinery or hand tools. This material often contains a lithologic discontinuity or a buried horizon just below an individual deposit. In some cases it is not possible to distinguish between human-transported material and parent material from mass movement processes (e.g., landslides) without intensive onsite examination and analysis. Human-transported material may be composed of either organic or mineral soil material and may contain detached pieces of diagnostic horizons which are derived from excavated soils. It may also contain artifacts (e.g., asphalt) that are not used as agricultural amendments (e.g., biosolids) or are litter discarded by humans (e.g., aluminum cans). Human- transported material has evidence that it did not originate from the same pedon which it overlies. In some soils, irregular distribution with depth or in proximity away from an anthropogenic landform, feature, or constructed object (e.g., a road or building) of modern products (e.g., radioactive fallout, deicers, or lead-based paint) may mark separate depositions of human-transported materials or mark the boundary with in situ soil material below or beside the human-transported material. In other soils, a discontinuity exists between the human-transported material and the parent material (e.g., a 2C horizon) or root-limiting layer (e.g., a 2R layer) beneath it. Multiple forms of evidence may be required to identify human- transported material where combinations of human actions and natural processes interact. Examples of these combinations include human-transported material deposited by dredging adjacent to active beaches, human- or water-deposited litter on flood plains and beneath water bodies, and deposits from natural geologic events (e.g., airfall volcanic ash) mantling anthropogenic landforms and microfeatures. Therefore, it is often the preponderance of evidence, including published or historical evidence and onsite observations, that allows identification of human-transported material."

Soils using these adjectives are considered extragrades since they do not represent an intergrade to any other named taxon (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). They are listed in order of interpretive significance as a guide, but the significance and order may change slightly depending on the great group in which they are recognized. They are not used in combination with each other even though some soils may have properties of several subgroups. These adjectives may be combined alphabetically with adjectives connoting other soil properties, such as high organic matter content (e.g., Anthropic Humic) or the presence of sulfidic materials (e.g., Anthroportic Sulfic), to form the names for additional extragrade subgroups. Additional adjectives for other properties will generally increase the importance of the subgroup and result in higher placement within a key to subgroups. 1. Anthraquic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. aqua, water).Soils that have anthraquic conditions (i.e., anthric saturation). These soils are extensive in flooded rice paddies. 2. Anthrodensic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. densus, marked by compactness).Soils that have a densic contact due to mechanical compaction (e.g., a compacted mine spoil) in more than 90 percent of the pedon (measured laterally) within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface. 3. Anthropic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human).Soils that have an anthropic epipedon based on the presence of artifacts or midden material. 4. Plaggic (modified from Ger. plaggen, sod).Soils that have a plaggen epipedon. 5. Haploplaggic (Gr. haplous, simple, and Ger. plaggen, sod).Soils that have a surface horizon 25 cm to less than 50 cm thick that meets all of the requirements for a plaggen epipedon except thickness. 6. Anthroportic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. portre, to carry).Soils that formed in 50 cm or more of human-transported material. This adjective is used primarily for soils that formed in human-transported material of dredged or mine spoil areas as well as for soils of urban areas and transportation corridors. * A void created when soil materials with a high content of rock fragments are transported and deposited without packing or sorting. The result is a trio of rock fragments stacked in a manner than prevents fine earth from filling the void. 7. Anthraltic (modified from Gr. anthropos, human, and L. alterre, to change).Soils that formed in 50 cm or more of human-altered material. This adjective is used primarily for human-altered material where ripping or deep plowing has fractured and displaced diagnostic subsurface horizons that were root-limiting (e.g., duripans) and in excavated areas (e.g., borrow pits).

The prevalence of rock structure that persists in the soil material is an indication that little pedogenic development has occurred. The lack of rock structure throughout most of a layer is a diagnostic criterion included in many of the definitions of diagnostic epipedons and subsurface horizons described in this chapter. Anthropic epipedon 2. The concept and definition of the anthropic epipedon was significantly revised from earlier editions of Soil Taxonomy at the recommendation of the International Committee for Anthropogenic Soils (ICOMANTH) in 2014. These changes were included in the 12th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The original concept for the anthropic epipedon was to recognize epipedons formed due to long-term human habitation, as evidenced by addition of middens, and to provide a place for mollic-like epipedons formed by long-term irrigation in arid areas, such as those that have been observed in Egypt and in the Americas, as a result of Native American cultural practices (Smith, 1986, pp. 101102). The major changes included the requirement that the epipedon be formed in human-transported or human-altered material, the elimination of requirements shared with the mollic epipedon (such as color, organic carbon, and base saturation), the elimination of the requirement for elevated phosphorous levels, and the exclusion of many mollic- like epipedons formed due to long-term irrigation of arid soils. Folistic epipedon 3. Guy Smith expressed the opinion that an alternate phrasing of this would be to say that they \"do not have an aquic soil moisture regime\" (Smith, 1986, p. 184). Today, we could specify that they do not have aquic conditions. 4. Most folistic epipedons consist of organic soil material (defined in chapter 2). Criterion 2 provides for a folistic epipedon that is an Ap horizon consisting of mineral soil material. Histic epipedon 5. The upper thickness ranges in items 1a and 1b equate to the values where the soil being classified is considered an organic soil rather than a mineral soil, and therefore technically no longer has a histic epipedon. 6. Most histic epipedons consist of organic soil material. Item 2 provides for a histic epipedon that is composed of mineral soil material. Cultivation and other similar disturbances tend to lead to loss of organic matter (especially the less decomposed fibric and hemic kinds) and development of structure due to drying, shrinking, enhanced aeration, and increased oxidation of the organic matter (Ewing et al., 2012). To accommodate this reduction in organic matter, the histic epipedon can be within the upper limits of the organic carbon requirement for mineral soil material. This adjustment was included to avoid taxonomic changes due to cultivation. See the 6th attribute of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999, chapter 2). A histic epipedon consisting of mineral soil material can also be part of a mollic or umbric epipedon. Melanic epipedon 7. The melanic epipedon was recommended for addition to Soil Taxonomy as a result of work by the International Committee for Andisols (ICOMAND). The concept originated in Japan. The epipedon was adopted and appeared in the 4th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1990). 8. Due to the depositional nature of the soil material making up many of these pedons, the melanic epipedon may have some thin intervening layers of loess or other non-volcanic materials that do not meet all the required characteristics; therefore, the required thickness is cumulative. 9. A melanic index value of less than 1.70 indicates that fulvic acids make up more than about 40 percent of the combined total of humic and fulvic acids in the organic fraction of the soil, thus suggesting a significant contribution from grass or grass-like plants. Mollic epipedon 10. Mixing to 18 cm is specified so that cultivated and uncultivated soils are treated the same. For undisturbed soils, \"mixing\" can generally be accomplished by calculating a weighted average for the property in question. Thorough physical mixing can also be performed if necessary. The use of a surface layer as a diagnostic criterion at a very high taxonomic level (soil order) in some ways violates the 6th attribute of Soil Taxonomy, i.e., keeping cultivated and undisturbed profiles together in the same class (see Soil Survey Staff, 1998, Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys, chapter 2). Cultivation and subsequent erosion can cause a soil to change classification where the mollic epipedon then fails minimum thickness requirements. Dr. Guy Smith struggled with this dilemma (Smith, 1986, p. 197) as have others over the years (for example, Olson et. al., 2005). 11. The restriction against being structureless (massive) and having hard, very hard, or harder consistence when dry was introduced to exclude some soils in Southern California and possibly elsewhere in the world that have carbon content and color meeting the criteria for the mollic epipedon, but that have adverse physical properties not shared by other soils with mollic epipedons (Smith, 1986, p. 156). 12. The n value is described in Pons and Zonneveld (1965). It is a calculated value based on the percentage of water held under field conditions as well as percentages of silt, sand, clay, and organic matter. It expresses the relative ability of soil under natural conditions to support a load such as grazing cattle or machinery. See the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, p. 189) for correlation of n value with fluidity classes. A fluidity class of nonfluid (i.e., deformable) is approximately equivalent to an n value of less than 0.7. 13. Finely divided CaCO3 acts as a white pigment and causes the soil to have a high color value, especially when dry. To compensate for the color of the carbonates, the mollic epipedon can have lighter color if the epipedon averages more than 15 percent carbonates. 14. The ammonium acetate method was chosen because many mollic epipedons (particularly those with an ustic soil moisture regime) contain free carbonates, so that the alternative sum of bases method is not useful. The 50 percent limit was a preliminary estimate based on limited data. It was not criticized so it has remained (Smith, 1986, p. 40). 15. A single standard thickness criterion is not used to define the mollic epipedon. The minimum required thickness depends on the overall depth and texture of the soil. The reason the minimum required thickness varies is to recognize the overall importance of the melanization process relative to other processes in the specific soil profile being evaluated. Allowance for a mollic epipedon less than 25 cm thick acknowledges the predominance of the melanization process in some soil profiles relative to other soil-forming processes. Plaggen epipedon 16. Guy Smith referred to the plaggen epipedon as \"primarily a European epipedon\" (Smith, 1986, p. 91). The earliest documented evidence for plaggen management dates to the Late Bronze Age, 3,000 years ago on the Island of Sylt, Denmark (Blume and Leinweber, 2004). Documented dates suggest that the technique became common in northwestern Europe around 1,000 years ago (Luise et al., 2014). The practice of adding manure and other amendments to improve the soil was mostly associated with the poorly fertile, sandy Spodosols. The practice mostly ceased by the turn of the 19th century, when fertilizers became available. Soils with plaggen epipedons were celebrated as the \"Soil of the Year\" in Germany in 2013 (Luise et al., 2014). 17. It should be noted that while the plaggen epipedon represents a soil-building management practice, it is at the expense of large areas of nearby (often low-lying) soils that were excavated and degraded to produce the bedding materials (Luise et al., 2014). Umbric epipedon 18. Mixing to 18 cm is specified so that cultivated and uncultivated soils are treated the same. For undisturbed soils, \"mixing\" can generally be accomplished by calculating a weighted average for the property in question. Thorough physical mixing can also be performed if necessary. 19. A single standard thickness criterion is not used to define the umbric epipedon. The minimum required thickness depends on the overall depth and texture of the soil. The reason the minimum required thickness varies is to recognize the overall importance of the melanization process relative to other processes in the specific soil profile being evaluated. Allowance for a mollic epipedon less than 25 cm thick acknowledges the predominance of the melanization process in some soil profiles relative to other soil-forming processes. Agric horizon 20. The agric horizon is not currently used to define any taxa. Prior to the 2nd edition of Soil Taxonomy it was used to define the now obsolete Agrudalfs. By its nature, the agric horizon is a relatively recently formed horizon (post cultivation) superimposed on the upper part of an existing diagnostic horizon, such as an argillic or cambic horizon, which is used in the classification. However, the agric horizon can be used as a defining characteristic for a soil series, or phase of a series. Agric horizons have not been commonly recognized in the United States, although they likely occur. 21. The pedogenic process contributing to the formation of the agric horizon is a unique form of illuviation occurring as a result of repeated anthropogenic disturbance of the overlying eluvial layer (Ap) and its impact on the underlying layer where illuviation takes place. The large pores in the plow layer and the absence of vegetation immediately after plowing permit a turbulent flow of muddy water to the base of the plow layer. Water enters wormholes or fine cracks between peds at the base of the plow layer, and the suspended materials are deposited as the water is withdrawn into capillary pores. The macropores in the form of worm channels, root channels, and surfaces of peds in the horizon underlying the plow layer become coated with a dark-colored mixture of organic matter, silt, and clay. The accumulations on the inside surfaces of wormholes become thick and can eventually fill the holes. If worms are scarce, the accumulations may take the form of lamellae formed by infilling structural pores that range in thickness from a few mm to about 1 cm. The lamellae and the coatings on the sides of wormholes always have a lower color value and chroma than the soil matrix. Albic horizon 22. The dominant processes leading to the formation of the albic horizon are argilluviation and/or podzolization. Argilluviation is the process of clay removal from the albic into an underlying horizon, such as an argillic horizon. Podzolization is the process of translocating iron and aluminum along with organic matter from the albic horizon into an underlying horizon, commonly a spodic or cambic horizon. Each process results in the stripping and eluviation of clay and iron oxides to the extent that the color of the horizon is the color of the primary sand and silt grains (often quartz) with few coatings remaining to provide a brownish or reddish pigment that masks the primary grain color. 23. By convention, the ochric epipedon includes any underlying eluvial horizons and extends to the first illuvial layer. Therefore, many albic horizons are also considered to be part of the ochric epipedon. Anhydritic horizon 24. Anhydrite (CaSO4 ) is a dehydrated analog of gypsum (CaSO4 .2H2 O). X-ray diffraction is required to distinguish anhydrite from gypsum. Wilson et al. (2013) report that quantification of anhydrite can be determined by the difference between the results from analysis by the acetone method (gypsum plus anhydrite) and low-temperature weight loss (for gypsum). In most environments, anhydrite is unstable and will readily combine with water when present, thus converting to the more stable mineral gypsum. However, anhydrite has been observed to remain stable after it forms in some strongly saline soils with high temperatures in Middle Eastern sabkhas, even when in contact with hypersaline ground water. It is theorized that the anhydrate-to-gypsum transformation is inhibited under strongly reducing conditions and in the presence of hydrogen sulfate. As a result, the geographic distribution of the anhydritic horizon is restricted to relatively few areas having favorable conditions (Shahid et al., 2007; Sarmast et al., 2016). Argillic horizon 25. Clay-sized calcium carbonate particles are not considered when evaluating a horizon for identification as an argillic horizon. Eluvial and illuvial horizon clay content comparisons are based upon silicate clays only. When present, carbonate clay must be subtracted from total clay when evaluating particle-size distribution data for the required clay increase of an argillic horizon. 26. Textural differentiation in soils with argillic horizons results from one or more processes acting simultaneously or sequentially and affecting surface horizons or subsurface horizons, or both. The degree to which a process, or several processes, operate varies widely from soil to soil. In some soils clay illuviation alone is significant, while in others clay illuviation is overshadowed by in situ weathering and dissolution of clays in the upper layers, leaching of the dissolved constituents to the subsoil, and neoformation of clays in the argillic horizon. In other cases, clay may be produced directly in the subsoil by weathering of primary minerals. Not all the processes are completely understood. However, the argillic horizon requires at least some evidence of clay illuviation. 27. Evidence of clay illuviation must be present in at least some part of the argillic horizon. Clay films, for example, may be evident only in the lower part of the argillic horizon in some soils. This is particularly true in some argillic horizons on old surfaces where the overlying eluvial horizon is highly weathered and thus little or no clay is produced and moving out of the layer today (for example, some Arenic and Grossarenic Paleudults). Clay films in the upper part of the argillic horizon in such soils may be disrupted by biological activity faster than they are produced. As clay continues to migrate deeper into the argillic, the clay films may be observable only in the lower parts of the argillic horizon. 28. Pressure faces are sometimes mistaken for clay films because they have a similar smooth, shiny appearance. The clay in clay films coats the surface, including sand grains, with a noticeable thickness of illuvial clay. If the surface feature is a pressure face alone, the sand grains are not coated with clay and the surface feature has little discernable thickness. 29. The 1 percent limit was chosen because it was assumed that if clay films are evident in the field there probably is also at least 1 percent identifiable oriented clay in thin sections. This assumption was not contradicted during testing of earlier versions of Soil Taxonomy, so this criterion has remained as originally proposed (Smith, 1986, p. 86). 30. These soils exhibit significant shrinking and swelling with seasonal moisture change. Where illuvial clay is present, the stress applied to ped surfaces may destroy incipient clay films as they form. In many such clayey horizons, identifying clay films is difficult or impossible. The higher proportion of fine clay in the illuvial horizon compared to the eluvial horizon is considered evidence of clay translocation. 31. The values \"3 percent,\" \"1.2 times,\" and \"8 percent\" were chosen because they are thought to be the minimum contrasts in clay content that can be reliably determined in the field by experienced soil scientists (Smith, 1986, p. 86). Calcic horizon 32. The change in required calcium carbonate equivalent (5 percent vs. 15 percent) for soils with less than or more than 18 percent clay, respectively, does not allow for a smooth transition from one case to the other. Smith (1986, p. 94) suggests that a sliding scale for required CCE based on clay content may have been more appropriate, but this has never been proposed. 33. Particle-size class terms are used in this required characteristic as a convenient proxy for many possible combinations of USDA texture class and texture modifier and do not imply that the soil meeting this option for the diagnostic horizon also meets the particle-size class criteria in the family classification. 34. The criteria given here are provided to allow the calcic horizon to contain pedogenically cemented layers that are too thin or discontinuous to meet the criteria for a petrocalcic horizon. Cambic horizon 35. Textures coarser than very fine sand were excluded from the cambic horizon because so little alteration is necessary to produce a color change in sandy soils. Dr. Guy Smith, in his discussion of the cambic horizon (Smith, 1986, p. 102), paraphrased Dr. Roy Simonson as saying, \"It doesn't take much paint to make a barn red. And in this case, it doesn't take much to color a sand grain.\" Duripan 36. The most common form of silica (SiO2 ) is the highly stable mineral quartz, which is inherited from the parent material. By contrast, the pedogenic forms of silica found in the duripan are less crystalline and partially hydrated. Pedogenic silica commonly consists of opal-A, opal-CT, chalcedony, and microcrystalline quartz (Monger and Kelly, 2002). 37. Criterion 3 requires a sequential treatment of (1) HCl to dissolve any carbonates cementing the layer, and (2) either KOH or NaOH to dissolve any silica cementing the layer. By estimating the volume of air-dry fragments that slake during each treatment, a determination can be made as to which is the dominant cementing agent. Fragipan 38. It should be noted that no minimum bulk density value is required for the identification of a fragipan. Absolute values vary considerably and bulk density per se is not directly responsible for root limitation in the horizon. (For an example, see Lindbo et al., 1994.) 39. Fragipans show evidence of pedogenesis, other than density and brittleness, such as oriented clay in the matrix or on the faces of peds, albic materials or coatings of albic materials on the faces of peds or in seams, soil structure, and/or redoximorphic features in the matrix or on the faces of peds. The fragipan, due to its pedogenic nature, stands in contrast to other nonpedogenic root-restrictive layers, such as those composed of paralithic materials (soft bedrock), or densic materials (for example, dense basal till). Given its pedogenic nature, it is recognized as a diagnostic horizon at a fairly high level in the taxonomy. 40. To be a fragipan, air-dry samples must slake when submerged in water. This criterion assures that the firm and brittle nature of the horizon is not due to significant pedogenic cementation of the grains making up the horizon. The factors giving rise to the unique properties of the fragipan are not fully understood. Close packing of the grains along with weak chemical bonds with silica, aluminum, or clay and iron oxides possibly play a role. Rupture-resistance classes and the tests for determining them are described in the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, pp. 181185). 41. Fragipans are not observed in calcareous materials. This suggests that carbonates hinder fragipan formation (Smith, 1986, p 77). This criterion was added with the 9th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003) to exclude some soils with carbonate-containing dense till. Glossic horizon 42. This degradation includes removal of clay and free iron oxides. The pedogenic processes generally considered to be responsible include argilluviation, which moves clay downward and blocks pores in the illuvial layer below; podzolization and development of albic materials; ferrolysis, which produces iron-rich materials in tongues of albic material penetrating the illuvial layer; and gleization (either localized between peds or throughout the horizon) resulting from periodic saturation and reduction. The material between the peds resulting from eluviation processes consists of light-colored and comparatively lighter textured albic material. The process of eluviation gradually progresses from the exterior of the peds to their interior. The glossic horizon generally continues to develop downward as the upper part of the illuvial horizon is degraded. The glossic horizon is commonly considered to be a mark of pedogenic age and landscape stability, especially as this horizon moves progressively downward into the illuvial layer and is overlain by an increasingly thick albic horizon. Gypsic horizon 43. The concept of the gypsic horizon having gypsum that has either accumulated (illuvial) or been at least partly transformed in place was introduced in the 11th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2010). Prior to this it was required to be illuvial in nature. Where illuvial in nature, the gypsum has been dissolved in one part of the profile, transferred to another part, and then precipitated near the wetting front where it accumulates over time. In soils that have ground water near the surface, capillary rise and evaporation plus transpiration can result in significant upward movement and accumulation of gypsum, sometimes at the soil surface. Many other gypsic horizons are not illuvial in nature. In soils that formed in highly gypsiferous parent material, such as residuum from gypsum rock, or eolian gypsum sands, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish gypsum that has undergone some degree of pedogenesis from gypsum that is lithogenic. This is because gypsum is relatively easily dissolved in water and then reprecipitated in place upon drying without being transferred significantly within the profile. It can be very difficult to distinguish gypsum that is truly illuvial in nature from gypsum that has simply been altered in place due to periodic wetting and drying (figure 3-16 is an example of such a situation). In either case, some degree of pedogenesis has likely taken place with gypsum that is, or has been, subject to wetting and drying. For this reason, there must simply be at least 1 percent, by volume, of the horizon with gypsum that has been transformed in order to qualify as a gypsic horizon. Kandic horizon 44. The concept of the kandic horizon and the \"kandi\" and \"kanhapli\" great groups of soils are the result of the work of the International Committee on the Classification of Low Activity Clays (ICOMLAC). A summary is in Soil Management Support Services (1986). These revisions were introduced in 1987 with the 3rd edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. 45. The identification of a kandic horizon requires that an overlying, coarser textured horizon be present for comparison. There is no provision therefore for identifying a kandic horizon exposed at the surface in a truncated soil. Such a horizon would likely meet the criteria for either an oxic or cambic horizon. If there is evidence of illuvial clay, it may meet the criteria for an argillic horizon since a provision for truncated soils is provided for the argillic horizon. 46. Originally, the proposed definition required mixing the upper 18 cm of the surface in all cases before verifying the required clay increase. This criterion is used throughout Soil Taxonomy to keep cultivated and uncultivated pedons in the same taxa. At the request of the Australians, an exception was created to allow as little as 5 cm for the coarser textured surface layer if there is an abrupt textural transition to the kandic. This allows for the recognition of kandic horizons in these soils. 47. The kandic horizon does not require that the increase in clay be due to illuviation. Textural differentiation in pedons with kandic horizons may result from one or more processes acting simultaneously or sequentially, affecting surface horizons, subsurface horizons, or both. In addition to illuviation, the clay difference between the surface and subsurface may be due to clay destruction in the surface layer, selective removal of fine particles from the surface due to erosion, or a lithologic discontinuity below the surface layer. The difficulty of finding evidence of clay illuviation in Ultisols and Alfisols dominated by low-activity clay was one of the important motivations for defining the kandic horizon without a requirement for illuvial clay (Soil Management Support Services, 1986). 48. The percentage of clay used in this determination is the higher of either (1) that measured by the pipette method, (2) that estimated by the formula: 2.5 times [percent water retained at 1500 kPa tension minus percent organic carbon], but not more than 100. Incomplete clay dispersion when using the pipette method is a common problem with many low-activity clay samples, thus the use of this formula is included as a criterion. 49. The term \"apparent\" is used here with CEC and ECEC to indicate that the calculation is for the clay fraction alone, not the entire fine-earth fraction. A mathematical adjustment of CEC and ECEC is performed to report them on a kg of clay basis: ACEC = [(CEC-7/clay %) x 100] AECEC = [(ECEC/clay %) x 100] These calculations are used as a kind of surrogate for the more difficult and expensive determination of clay mineralogy as an easier way to document the dominance of low-activity clay in the horizon. Although easier to obtain, it must be recognized that CEC values per unit of clay are by definition low in these soils. Therefore, small errors in the measurements of exchangeable cations and clay content can result in significant variation in the calculated values for apparent CEC and apparent ECEC. This becomes more of a problem as clay content decreases and is one of the reasons for the exclusion of sandy textures from the kandic horizon (Kimble et al., 1993). Natric horizon 50. The natric horizon is a special kind of argillic horizon. Like the argillic horizon, it is a subsoil horizon enriched with illuvial clay. In addition to the properties of the argillic horizon, the natric horizon has elevated levels of sodium, which enhances the dispersion of clay particles, thus facilitating illuviation. There is no field test that can be used to confirm the presence of sodium in the horizon. Laboratory analysis is required. Soil-related clues that may indicate the presence of sodium include high pH, columnar or prismatic structure in the subsoil with light-colored eluvial caps and penetrations, puddled and sealed surfaces (\"slick spots\") in the field, sodium-tolerant natural vegetation, or the poor response of cultivated crops. 51. Many natric horizons have columnar or prismatic structure in at least part of the horizon. This structure, however, may be weakly expressed, especially in some coarser textured natric horizons. Some natric horizons have a blocky structure accompanied by eluvial materials on the upper surfaces of peds that extend into the horizon. 52. Magnesium is considered in the definition of the natric horizon (item 7b in the section on required characteristics). This is because as sodium is removed, magnesium follows in the leaching sequence if chlorides are low and sulfates are high. If leaching continues, the magnesium also is eventually replaced. When replacement reaches the point where the amount of exchangeable sodium is less than 15 percent and the amount of magnesium and sodium is less than that of calcium and exchange acidity in upper subhorizons that have a total thickness of 40 cm or more, the horizon is no longer considered natric. The remains of such former natric horizons are evident in soils in which the characteristic columnar structure is clearly evident but all other properties have been altered because of a greatly changed environment or continued leaching. Ortstein 53. Ortstein is used explicitly in Soil Taxonomy as a family-level rupture-resistance class term for some Spodosols. These soils have a spodic horizon that is at least partially pedogenically cemented (50 percent or more laterally) in some part. A spodic horizon that is continuously cemented laterally (at least 90 percent cemented) qualifies for a \"dur\" great group of some Spodosols, but the great group criteria do not specifically require the cemented layer to be ortstein as defined here. 54. Iron, manganese, and aluminum weathered from ferromagnesian minerals (such as hornblende, amphiboles, pyroxene, and olivine), along with dissolved organic carbon, are eluviated from the upper part of the acid soil and moved downward into the subsoil, where they accumulate and form a spodic horizon. In addition, some amorphous minerals such as allophane and ferrihydrite are commonly present. The iron, manganese, and aluminum interact with organic matter to form metal-humus complexes in the form of amorphous gels coating the grains of the horizon matrix. Oxic horizon 55. These are minerals that are \"weatherable\" in a humid climate. They include minerals such as 2:1 phyllosilicates, allophane, feldspars, dolomite, etc. The intent is to include only those minerals that are unstable in a humid climate compared to other more resistant minerals, such as quartz and 1:1 lattice clays that are more resistant to weathering than calcite. Calcite, carbonate aggregates, anhydrite, gypsum, and halite are not considered weatherable minerals here because they are mobile in the soil and may be recharged in some otherwise strongly weathered soils (for example, from falling dust or by evaporative wicking processes above a water table). For soil classification purposes, the content of weatherable minerals is determined by petrographic analysis (grain counts) of grains 0.02 to 2.0 mm in size (coarse silt to very coarse sand) or other grain size as specified in the various keys. Soil Taxonomy does not contain a list of minerals considered to be weatherable or resistant. Rather it refers to the Soil Survey Laboratory Information Manual (Soil Survey Staff, 2011, pp. 295297). 56. The oxic horizon is at least 30 cm thick. This limit ensures that thin horizons with oxic-like properties that are transitional to another diagnostic horizon (such as an argillic horizon), or to underlying saprolite, are not included as oxic horizons (Smith, 1986, p. 106). 57. Originally, the oxic horizon required a minimum clay content of 15 percent to support the separation of Oxisols from Oxic great groups of Quartzipsamments (Smith, 1986, p.107). This criterion was dropped in the 3rd edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1987) and replaced with these texture classes, as recommended by the International Committee on Oxisols (ICOMOX). This was done to allow a wider range of clay in coarse-loamy families of Oxisols (previously restricted to just 15 to 18 percent). However, it leaves open the possibility for an oxic horizon with appreciable silt to have nearly zero clay. Small errors in the calculations of CEC and ECEC produce large variation in computed values when converted to a clay fraction basis for these low-clay oxic horizons. This can be problematic when assessing the chemical criteria for oxic horizons. Most oxic horizons, however, have low silt contents, so this is not a common problem. 58. The 10 percent weatherable mineral limit was set to approximate a base cation reserve of only about 25 cmol(+)/kg soil (Herbillon, 1988). 59. This requirement excludes saprolitic materials that are completely weathered chemically, but not yet physically altered, from the oxic horizon (Smith, 1986, p. 107). 60. For the oxic horizon, any increase in clay cannot exceed a value of between 4 and 8 percent, depending on the texture of the surface layer. These limits are used to separate the oxic and kandic horizons. The main difference between the oxic and kandic horizons is that the kandic horizon has a marked clay increase from the surface layer to the subsoil, while the oxic horizon does not. 61. Laboratory analysis for particle-size determination in low-activity clay soils such as these may be hindered by poor dispersion of clay particles in the standard pretreatment process. This is because clay particles may be bound more strongly than the standard pretreatment with sodium hexametaphosphate and mechanical shaking can effectively separate. While alternate laboratory methods could be used to achieve better dispersion, this is not practical on a routine basis in soil survey work and not deemed necessary for classification purposes. Rather, determination of the clay content for application of the oxic horizon criteria requires that the amount measured by pipette using the standard procedure be compared to the calculated value used in the criterion. A slightly different equation using a factor of 2.5 rather than 3 is used to determine clay content for the kandic horizon and other soils where poor dispersion is a problem. Holzhey and Kimble (1988), however, reported that a factor of 3 was better than 2.5 for use with the Oxisols. Petrocalcic horizon 62. The petrocalcic horizon is essentially an advanced-stage calcic horizon where so much secondary calcium carbonate has accumulated in the layer that the pores have become plugged and the grains cemented. Air-dry fragments do not slake in water but will slake in HCl, thus confirming calcium carbonate as the cementing agent. The carbonates may have been deposited (e.g., as dust) from outside the profile or, in naturally calcareous parent materials, the carbonates may be dissolved and reprecipitated locally within the horizon. Igneous parent materials with high concentrations of calcium, such as basalts, also give rise to the formation of petrocalcic horizons. Petrocalcic horizons are commonly found in arid or semiarid environments where deep leaching and removal of soluble salts like calcium carbonate do not occur. For a brief discussion of the stages of carbonate accumulation see the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, pp. 175176). Petrogypsic horizon 63. The petrogypsic horizon is essentially an advanced- stage gypsic horizon where so much secondary gypsum has accumulated in the layer that the pores have become plugged and the grains cemented. Air-dry fragments do not readily slake in water. Commonly, the gypsum was naturally occurring in the parent materials, where it was dissolved and reprecipitated locally within the horizon. Petrogypsic horizons are commonly found in arid or semiarid environments where deep leaching and removal of soluble salts like gypsum do not occur. Placic horizon 64. Within spodic materials, the placic horizon is differentiated from ortstein primarily based on thickness. Placic horizons that are within spodic materials are less than 25 mm thick (ortstein is 25 mm or more thick). There is no maximum thickness criterion for placic horizons that are not in spodic materials. Placic horizons are sufficiently continuous laterally to allow roots to enter the horizon with no closer than an average 10 cm spacing. In addition, ortstein consists of spodic materials while a placic horizon may or may not meet the definition of spodic materials. Alumino-humus complexes appear to be more important in the formation of ortstein while iron and organic matter precipitation due to redox processes is more important in placic horizon formation (Lapan and Wang, 1999). Salic horizon 65. Halite is one of the more common salts in salic horizons, but other salts also occur. The salic horizon may be either in the subsoil (where precipitation leaches salts downward) or at the surface (where salts are wicking upward from a water table within the profile). Where this horizon is at the surface, there may be a polygonal pattern of slightly elevated ridges caused by surface heaving as the salt crystals accumulate. In the laboratory, the salt concentration is evaluated by measuring electrical conductivity of a saturated paste extract. The level of salt concentration may vary seasonally as salts are partially leached during rainy periods and accumulate through evapotranspiration during dry periods. In extremely arid areas, such as parts of Chile and Antarctica, where measurable precipitation rarely occurs, salic horizons have a hard or rigid rupture-resistance class. These types of salic horizons are physical barriers to roots, but air-dry submerged samples slake in water and, therefore, are not considered pedogenically cemented. Sombric horizon 66. Sombric horizon genesis is not well understood. Some hypotheses described by Bockheim (2012) include buried surface layers, charcoal accumulation due to burning, conversion of lower parts of previously formed thick surface horizons due to climate and vegetation change, and migration of clay-humus complexes into the subsoil. Additional study is needed to better understand these unique soil horizons. Sombric horizons are not known to occur in the United States and were included in Soil Taxonomy with a relatively incomplete understanding of their extent, genesis, and properties (Smith, 1986, p. 223). 67. In the field, a sombric horizon may be mistaken for a buried A horizon. The reverse is also a problem in that buried surface layers can be mistaken for a sombric horizon. The sombric horizon can be distinguished from some buried epipedons by lateral tracing. It is a continuous layer roughly paralleling the soil surface. Also, in thin sections the organic matter of a sombric horizon appears to be dark-colored humus that is concentrated on ped surfaces and in pores and is not uniformly dispersed throughout the matrix (as would be expected if the horizon were a buried surface layer). Spodic horizon 68. The International Committee for Spodosols (ICOMOD) proposed significant revisions to the Spodosol order and the spodic horizon, which were adopted with the 5th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1995). The development of criteria emphasizing field-observable morphology was an important aspect of the committee's work. As a result, the current criteria utilize field-observable morphology as much as possible to identify Spodosols while keeping the necessary laboratory data to a minimum. An important result of ICOMOD's work was the introduction of sodic materials as a diagnostic characteristic. Abrupt textural change 69. An abrupt textural change significantly restricts the downward movement of water. From the standpoint of soil genesis, it generally suggests that the soil formed on a relatively stable geomorphic surface of significant age. Albic materials 70. Relatively unaltered layers of light-colored sand, volcanic ash, or other materials deposited by wind or water are not considered albic materials, although they may have the same color and apparent morphology. These deposits are parent materials that are not characterized by the removal of clay and/or free iron and do not overlie an illuvial horizon or other soil horizon, except for a buried soil. Light-colored krotovinas or filled root channels should be considered albic materials only if they have no fine stratifications or lamellae, if any sealing along the krotovina walls has been destroyed, and if these intrusions have been leached of free iron oxides and/or clay after deposition. Andic soil properties 71. Andic soil materials are similar to spodic materials, with one significant difference being the illuvial nature of spodic materials. Spodic materials have been translocated within the soil profile. Andic soil materials have formed in place with little or no translocation within the profile. Anhydrous conditions 72. Anhydrous conditions were proposed as a diagnostic feature by the International Committee on Permafrost Affected Soils (ICOMPAS) and adopted with the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1998), effectively replacing the moisture regime in the classification for very cold and dry permafrost- affected soils (e.g., Anhyorthels). This was done rather than either revising the aridic moisture regime to include Gelisols or introducing a new moisture regime for these dry Gelisols. Coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE) 73. COLE is used in Soil Taxonomy as a criterion for argillic and natric horizons to identify conditions of high shrink-swell potential (COLE > 0.4) where the visual evidence of clay illuviation (such as oriented clay occurring as clay films on faces of peds and in pores) is likely to be destroyed due to soil movement. Values of COLE for individual horizons can be summed over horizon thickness to determine overall potential for soil movement for the soil profile (linear extensibility). This is useful in making interpretations for soils subject to significant shrinking and swelling with moisture change. Free carbonates 74. Free carbonates may be a precipitate dispersed throughout the soil matrix, or they may have been present in the original parent material. Therefore, their presence does not automatically imply pedogenesis. In some situations, their presence or absence in a soil horizon may infer leaching or a lack thereof. Interfingering of albic materials 75. By inference, a horizon with interfingering of albic materials may be on a genetic pathway to forming a glossic horizon. Once the albic materials comprise 15 percent or more of the volume, a glossic horizon is recognized. Lamellae 76. Lamellae are pedogenic in nature, not simply fine stratifications in layered deposits. They have the effect of slowing water movement through the soil profile, thus increasing the time the water is available for plant uptake. In addition, depending on the kind of clay minerals, lamellae may also have the effect of concentrating much of the overall CEC and fertility of the soil into the volume of soil composed of individual lamella. Lithologic discontinuities 77. Lithologic discontinuity is one of just a few diagnostic characteristics lacking a clear, quantitative definition. It is somewhat subjective since there is no simple way to construct a universally applicable definition to recognize all conditions reflecting a change in lithology or age. Because of this, individual soil scientists will sometimes differ about recognizing a lithologic discontinuity in a given soil profile (Smith, 1986, pp. 7374). The presence of a lithologic discontinuity is not used explicitly in any criteria in Soil Taxonomy, although many soils having a contrasting family particle-size class have a lithologic discontinuity. In addition, some soil series definitions include the presence of a lithologic discontinuity as a criterion. n value 78. Soil materials that are thixotropic exhibit a greasy feel and a release of water when pressure is applied to a field moist sample, i.e., rubbed between the fingers. This is due to the unusually high water retention capacity of the material. Examples are soils with significant amounts of amorphic materials with high surface area from convoluted hollow microscopic shapes, such as soils with andic soil properties or spodic materials. In soil descriptions, this property is described using smeariness classes (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017, p. 189). Plinthite 79. The number of wetting and drying cycles required for irreversible hardening is not specified and likely varies depending on local conditions. Plinthite that has become hard can often be observed by tracing the layer containing plinthite to a nearby roadcut or other exposure where it has become hardened over time. Slickensides 80. Slickensides are considered to be pedogenic when associated with soil peds or features such as wedges or bowls in Vertisols. The term \"slickenside\" is also used in a geogenic context (nonpedogenic) when associated with tectonic or mass movement features, such as faults or slump blocks. Spodic materials 81. Spodic materials impart unique properties to the soil, including a high cation-exchange capacity, a large surface area relative to its particle-size distribution, high water retention, reddish color, low pH, and a high content of organic carbon. Ortstein and some placic horizons are composed of spodic materials. Spodic materials are similar to andic soil materials; one significant difference is that spodic materials are illuvial in nature while andic soil materials formed in place with little or no translocation. The ODOE test and extractions of aluminum and iron by ammonium acetate are used to support the inference of illuviation for spodic materials. Spodic materials were proposed as a diagnostic characteristic for Soil Taxonomy by the International Committee for Spodosols (ICOMOD) and appeared in the 5th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1992). 82. The recognition of spodic materials in an Ap horizon avoids the problem of cultivation causing a change in the classification of a soil with a very shallow spodic horizon. 83. A primary goal of the International Committee for Spodosols (ICOMOD) was to put as much emphasis as possible on field morphology and less emphasis on laboratory data for the identification of Spodosols. Criterion 2a allows many spodic horizons to be identified based on field morphology alone. Where this does not work, criterion 2b is used to test for the presence of spodic materials in the suspected spodic horizon. Control section for organic soils 84. The use of two control section depths based on kinds of organic materials was established based on the assumption that these soils would react differently to drainage. It was supposed that after drainage and subsequent volume loss due to oxidation, the lower density organic soil materials with the thicker control section would subside more than the higher density soil materials and eventually have about the same control section thickness that the higher bulk density organic materials would. (Smith, 1986, p. 182). Aquic conditions 85. The definition of aquic conditions does not include any specified depth. Aquic conditions can occur at any depth in the soil. The depth required for any taxonomic class, such as a suborder or subgroup, is specified in the keys. Beginning with the 5th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1992), aquic conditions replaced the requirement for an aquic soil moisture regime as a diagnostic criterion. This was proposed by the International Committee on Aquic Moisture Regimes (ICOMAQ). The aquic soil moisture regime became obsolete for classifying a soil at the suborder level. Although still recognized in Soil Taxonomy, it is no longer mentioned in any of the keys to suborders. It has been replaced in the keys by aquic conditions. Even though the aquic moisture regime is not used in the keys, soils are still recognized as having an aquic (or peraquic) soil moisture regime in their descriptions. 86. Reduction is not defined in a quantitative way due to the difficulty of setting threshold redox potential (Eh) values reflecting many possible environmental conditions, especially pH (as shown in pH/Eh diagrams depicting the stability of mineral species). In addition, no minimum time period is specified for the soil to be saturated because this would vary from place to place. The degree of reduction required is (for practical reasons) equated with that needed to reduce iron since this results in the morphological expression of redox features given in the keys and can also be documented with field tools such as dyes (i.e., alpha,alpha-dipyridyl) or IRIS tubes. These techniques are easier to perform and interpret than measuring redox potential directly with electronic instruments. 87. As recommended by ICOMAQ, the term \"mottles\" is no longer used to describe morphology associated with wetness. Furthermore, the term \"mottles with chroma 2 or less\" was removed from the keys beginning with the 5th edition in 1992. The more precise terms introduced for redoximorphic features (along with their color and location) are used to document the morphological expression of saturation and reduction. The term \"mottles\" is used to describe color patterns that are due to conditions other than redox processes (such as lithochromic color variation). 88. Alph,alpha-dipyridyl is a compound that when dissolved in 1N ammonium acetate is used to detect the presence of reduced iron (Fe2+ ). It is used as a simple field test in wet soils, particularly those with no visible redoximorphic features, to confirm that the soil is reduced. A positive reaction satisfies the criterion for redoximorphic features in the definition of aquic conditions in Soil Taxonomy. It should be noted that a positive reaction will only occur when the iron is currently in a reduced state. If this soil is tested when the iron is in an oxidized state (such as during the dry season), no reaction will occur even though the soil is subject to periodic saturation and reduction. Densic materials 89. All other diagnostic horizons are mutually exclusive of also being recognized as densic materials. Therefore, a plow pan or other mechanically compacted layer that formed in the upper part of a diagnostic horizon, such as a cambic horizon, is not considered to have densic materials or a densic contact. Normal years 90. The term \"normal years\" has a rigorous definition utilizing a statistical analysis of the variability of annual and monthly precipitation data to identify a given year as normal as opposed to abnormally wet or dry. In practice it has been found to be difficult to apply the definition in some cases because an unexpectedly large number of years failed the definition and therefore could not be included in analysis to determine the soil moisture regime class. The application of the definition of normal years was relaxed a bit with the 11th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy to allow some of these years to be used in the determination under the circumstances described in the definition. Cryic soil temperature regime 91. The criteria for the cryic soil temperature regime are designed to take into account the moderating effect of an organic surface layer and/or the presence of water on soil temperature. The presence of an organic surface layer in particular can be impacted by occasional fire or other disturbance. Removal of the O layer results in warmer summer temperatures. Family and Series Differentiae and Names Families and series serve purposes that are largely pragmatic; the series name is abstract, and the technical family name is descriptive. In this chapter the descriptive terms used in the names of families are defined, the control sections to which the terms apply are given, and the criteria, including the taxa in which they are used, are indicated (note 1)."

      "term": "Family Differentiae for Mineral Soils and",
      "definition": "Mineral Layers of Some Organic Soils The following differentiae are used to distinguish families of mineral soils and the mineral layers of some organic soils within a subgroup. The class names of these differentiae are used to form the family name. The class names are listed and defined in the same sequence (shown below) in which they appear in the family names. Particle-size classes and their substitutes Human-altered and human-transported material classes Mineralogy classes Cation-exchange activity classes Calcareous and reaction classes Soil temperature classes Soil depth classes Rupture-resistance classes Classes of coatings on sands Classes of permanent cracks Particle-Size Classes and Their Substitutes Definition of Particle-Size Classes and Their Substitutes for Mineral Soils The first part of the family name is the name of either a particle-size class or a substitute for a particle-size class. The term \"particle-size class\" is used to characterize the grain-size composition of the whole soil, including both the fine earth and the rock and pararock fragments up to the size of a pedon, but it excludes organic matter and salts more soluble than gypsum. Substitutes for particle-size classes are used for soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, cinders, rock fragments, or gypsum. In general, the weighted average particle-size class of the whole particle-size control section (defined below) determines what particle-size class is used for the family name. Development of particle-size classes for Soil Taxonomy The particle-size classes of this taxonomy represent a compromise between conventional divisions in pedologic and engineering classifications. Engineering classifications have set the limit between sand and silt at a diameter of 74 microns, while pedological classifications have set it at either 20, 50, or 63 microns. The USDA and this taxonomy use a diameter of 50 microns to set the limit between sand and silt. Engineering classifications have been based on grain-size percentages, by weight, in the soil fraction less than 75 mm (3 inches) in diameter, while texture classes in pedologic classifications have been based on percentages, by weight, in the fraction less than 2.0 mm in diameter. In engineering classifications, the separate very fine sand (diameter between 50 and 100 microns or 0.05 and 0.1 mm) has been subdivided at 74 microns. In defining the particle-size classes for this taxonomy, a similar division has been made, but in a different way. Soil materials that have a texture class of fine sand or loamy fine sand normally have an appreciable amount of very fine sand, most of which is coarser than 74 microns. A silty sediment, such as loess, may also contain an appreciable amount of very fine sand, most of which is finer than 74 microns. Thus, in the design of particle-size classes for this taxonomy, the very fine sand has been allowed to \"float\" (note 2). It is included with the sand fraction if the texture class (fine-earth fraction) of a soil is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or coarser. It is treated as silt, however, if the texture class is very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, silt loam, or finer. Generalized versus narrowly defined classes No single set of particle-size classes seems adequate to serve as family differentiae for all of the different kinds of soil. Thus, this taxonomy provides 2 generalized and 10 more narrowly defined classes, which permit relatively fine distinctions between families of soils for which particle size is important, while providing broader groupings for soils in which narrowly defined particle-size classes would produce undesirable separations. Thus, the term \"clayey\" is used for some soil families to indicate a clay content of 35 percent (30 percent in Vertisols) or more in specific horizons, while in other families the more narrowly defined terms \"fine\" and \"very-fine\" indicate that these horizons have a clay content either of 35 percent (30 percent in Vertisols) to 60 percent or of 60 percent or more in their fine-earth fraction. Fine earth, rock and pararock fragments, and artifacts Fine earth refers to particles smaller than 2 mm in diameter. Rock fragments are particles 2 mm or more in diameter that are strongly coherent or more resistant to rupture and include all particles with horizontal dimensions smaller than the size of a pedon. Coherent fragments 2 mm or more in diameter that are in a rupture-resistance class that is less than strongly coherent are referred to as pararock fragments. Pararock fragments, like rock fragments, include all particles between 2 mm and a horizontal dimension smaller than the size of a pedon. Most pararock fragments are broken into particles less than 2 mm in diameter during the preparation of samples for particle-size analysis in the laboratory. Therefore, pararock fragments are generally included with the fine earth in the assignment of particle-size classes. However, cinders, lapilli, pumice, and pumicelike fragments are treated as general fragments in the pumiceous and cindery substitute classes (defined below), regardless of their rupture-resistance class. Rock fragments and pararock fragments may be of either geologic or pedogenic origin. Artifacts (defined in chapter 3) are of human origin. Artifacts 2 mm or larger in diameter which are both cohesive and persistent* (e.g., brick) are treated as rock fragments for the assignment of particle-size classes. Particle-size substitutes Substitutes for particle-size classes are used for soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, cinders, rock fragments, or gypsum. These materials cannot be readily dispersed and have variable results of dispersion. The substitute classes dominated by rock and pararock fragments have too little fine-earth material for valid data, and soil properties are dominated by the fragments. Consequently, normal particle-size classes do not adequately characterize these soils. Substitutes for particle-size class names are used for those parts of soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, or cinders, as is the case with Andisols and many Andic and Vitrandic subgroups of other soil orders. The \"gypseous\" substitutes for particle- size class are used for mineral soils (e.g., Aridisols) that have a high content of gypsum. Some Spodosols, whether identified in Andic subgroups or not, have andic soil properties in some horizons within the particle-size control section, and particle- size substitute class names are used for these horizons. Soils with no particle-size or substitute class Neither a particle-size class nor a substitute for a particle-size class is used for Psamments, Psammaquents, Psammowassents, Psammoturbels, Psammorthels, and Psammentic subgroups that meet sandy particle-size class criteria. These taxa, by definition, meet sandy particle-size class criteria (i.e., have a texture class of sand or loamy sand), so the sandy particle-size class is considered redundant in the family name. The ashy substitute class, however, is used in these taxa if appropriate (e.g., high content of volcanic glass). Application to soils with significant amorphous mineral content Particle-size classes are applied, although with reservations, to the control sections of soils with spodic horizons and other horizons that do not have andic soil properties but contain significant amounts of allophane, imogolite, ferrihydrite, or aluminum-humus complexes. The isotic mineralogy class (defined below) is helpful in identifying these particle-size classes. Strongly Contrasting Particle-Size Classes If the particle-size control section consists of two parts with strongly contrasting particle-size or substitute classes (listed below), if both parts are 12.5 cm or more thick (including parts not in the control section), and if the transition zone between them is less than 12.5 cm thick, both class names are used (note 3). For example, the family particle-size class is sandy over clayey if all of the following criteria are met: the soil meets criterion D (listed below) under the control section for particle- size classes or their substitutes; any Ap horizon is less than 30 cm thick; the weighted average particle-size class of the upper 30 cm of the soil is sandy; the weighted average of the lower part is clayey; and the transition zone is less than 12.5 cm thick. If a substitute name applies to one or more parts of the particle- size control section and the parts are not strongly contrasting classes, the name of the thickest part (cumulative) is used as the soil family name. Aniso Class [see footnote] If the particle-size control section includes more than one pair of the strongly contrasting classes, listed below, then the soil is assigned to an aniso class named for the pair of adjacent classes that contrast most strongly. The aniso class is considered a modifier of the particle-size class name and is set off by commas after the particle-size name. An example is a sandy over clayey, aniso, mixed, active, mesic Aridic Haplustoll. Application of Generalized Particle-Size Classes Two generalized particle-size classes, loamy and clayey, are used for shallow classes (defined below) and for soils in Arenic, * Artifact cohesion is the relative ability of an artifact to remain intact after significant disturbance and is based on whether the artifact can be easily broken into pieces less than 2 mm in diameter either by hand or with a mortar and pestle. Cohesive artifacts cannot easily be broken. Artifact persistence is the relative ability of artifacts to withstand weathering and decay over time. Persistent artifacts remain intact for a decade or more. Part 618 of the National Soil Survey Handbook (available online) contains more information on the data elements used for describing artifacts.  [see footnote] For guidance on the application of the aniso class, see Soil Survey Technical Note Number 3. Grossarenic, and Lithic subgroups. The clayey class is used for all strongly contrasting particle-size classes with more than 35 percent clay (30 percent in Vertisols). The loamy particle- size class is used for contrasting classes, where appropriate, to characterize the lower part of the particle-size control section. The generalized classes, where appropriate, are also used for all strongly contrasting particle-size classes that include a substitute class. For example, loamy over pumiceous or cindery (not fine-loamy over pumiceous or cindery) is used. Six generalized classes, defined later in this chapter, are used for Terric subgroups of Histosols and Histels."

      "definition": "Substitutes in Mineral Soils The particle-size and substitute class names listed below are applied to certain horizons, or to the soil materials within specific depth limits, that have been designated as the control section for particle-size classes and their substitutes (note 4). The lower boundary of the control section may be at a specified depth (in centimeters) below the mineral soil surface or below the upper boundary of an organic layer with andic soil properties, or it may coincide with the upper boundary of a root- limiting layer (defined below). Root-Limiting Layers The concept of root-limiting layers as used in this taxonomy defines the base of the soil horizons considered for most (but not all) differentiae at the family level. The properties of soil materials above the base and within the control section are used for assignment of classes, such as particle-size classes and their substitutes. One notable exception to the concept of root-limiting layers is in assignment of soil depth classes (defined below) to soils with fragipans. Unless otherwise indicated, the following are considered root-limiting layers in this chapter: a duripan; a fragipan; petrocalcic, petrogypsic, and placic horizons; continuous ortstein (i.e., 90 percent or more pedogenically cemented and with lateral continuity); and densic, lithic, manufactured layer, paralithic, and petroferric contacts (note 5). Key to the Control Section for Particle-Size Classes and Their Substitutes in Mineral Soils The following list of particle-size control sections for particular kinds of mineral soils is arranged as a key. This key, like other keys in this taxonomy, is designed in such a way that the reader makes the correct classification by going through the key systematically, starting at the beginning and eliminating one by one all classes that include criteria that do not fit the soil in question. The soil belongs to the first class for which it meets all of the criteria listed. The upper boundary of an argillic, natric, or kandic horizon is used in the following key. This boundary is not always obvious. If one of these horizons is present but the upper boundary is irregular or broken, as in an A/B or B/A horizon, the depth at which half or more of the volume has the fabric of an argillic, natric, or kandic horizon should be considered the upper boundary.

The class or substitute name for each layer within the control section must be determined from the key. If any two layers meet the criteria for strongly contrasting particle-size classes (listed below), the soil is named for that strongly contrasting class. If more than one pair meets the criteria for strongly contrasting classes, the soil is also in an aniso class named for the pair of adjacent classes that contrast most strongly. If the soil has none of the strongly contrasting classes, the weighted average soil materials (note 6) within the particle-size control section generally determine the class. Exceptions are soils that are not strongly contrasting and that have a substitute class name for one or more parts of the control section. In these soils the class or substitute name of the thickest (cumulative) part within the control section is used to determine the family name. In the classes under item C below, \"clay\" excludes clay-sized carbonates. Carbonates of clay size are treated as silt. If the ratio of percent water retained at 1500 kPa tension to the percentage of measured clay is 0.25 or less or 0.6 or more in half or more of the particle-size control section or part of the particle-size control section in strongly contrasting classes, then poor dispersion or other factors are assumed to be hindering accurate particle-size analysis by standard laboratory procedures. In this case, the percentage of clay is estimated by the formula: Clay % = 2.5(% water retained at 1500 kPa tension - % organic carbon).

Use of Human-Altered and Human-Transported Material Classes Human-altered and human-transported material classes are only used in taxa of mineral soils where one of the following occurs: (1) human-altered or human-transported material extends from the soil surface to a depth of 50 cm or to a root-limiting layer, whichever is shallower; or (2) the soil classifies in an Anthraltic, Anthraquic, Anthrodensic, Anthropic, Anthroportic, Haploplaggic, or Plaggic extragrade subgroup (defined in chapter 3). In other taxa, the class is omitted from the family name and the parent material is identified at the soil series level. Examples of soils that are named using human-altered and human-transported material classes and that formed in human-transported material are a fine, methanogenic, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic Anthrodensic Ustorthent, which was compacted during construction of a sanitary landfill, and a fine- loamy, spolic, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Anthroportic Udorthent, which resulted from reclamation of a surface coal mine. An example of a soil that is named using a human-altered and human-transported material class and that formed in human-altered material as a result of mechanical displacement of a preexisting natric horizon is a fine, araric, smectitic, calcareous, thermic Anthraltic Sodic Xerorthent. Key to the Control Section for Human-Altered and Human- Transported Material Classes The control section for the human-altered and human- transported material classes is from the soil surface to one of the following depths, whichever is shallower: 1. 200 cm; or 2. The lower boundary of the deepest horizon formed in human-altered or human-transported material; or 3. A lithic or paralithic contact. Key to Human-Altered and Human-Transported Material Classes The following key to human-altered and human-transported material classes is designed to make important distinctions in the order of most importance to human health and safety. The soil belongs to the first class for which it meets all of the required criteria."

      "definition": "The cation-exchange activity classes are used to make interpretations about the nutrient-holding capacity of soils and their suites of colloids. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is determined by NH4 OAc at pH 7 on the fine-earth fraction. The CEC of the organic matter, sand, silt, and clay is included in the determination. The criteria for the classes use ratios of CEC to the percent, by weight, of silicate clay, calculated by weighted average in the control section. In the following classes \"clay\" excludes clay-sized carbonates. Percent carbonate clay must be subtracted from percent total clay before the CEC to clay ratio is calculated. If the ratio of percent water retained at 1500 kPa tension to the percentage of measured clay is 0.25 or less or 0.6 or more in half or more of the particle-size control section (or in a part of contrasting families), then the percentage of clay is estimated by the following formula: Clay % = 2.5(% water retained at 1500 kPa tension - % organic carbon).

      "definition": "Cation-exchange activity classes are used for soils classified in the mixed or siliceous mineralogy classes of clayey, clayey- skeletal, coarse-loamy, coarse-silty, fine, fine-loamy, fine-silty, loamy, loamy-skeletal, and very-fine particle-size classes. They are not assigned to Histosols and Histels nor to Oxisols or \"kandi\" and \"kanhap\" great groups and subgroups of Alfisols and Ultisols because assigning classes to organic soils or taxa defined by low-activity clay would be misleading or redundant information. Cation-exchange activity classes are not assigned to Psamments, \"psamm\" great groups of Entisols and Gelisols, Psammentic subgroups, or other soils with sandy or sandy- skeletal particle-size classes or the fragmental substitute class because the low clay content causes cation-exchange activity classes to be less useful and less reliable. Soils with other substitutes for particle-size class (e.g., ashy) or with mineralogy classes such as smectitic also are not assigned cation-exchange activity classes, since such soils have a high cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and/or the clay mineralogy dictates soil properties. Application for soils with contrasting particle-size classes For soils with strongly contrasting particle-size classes, where both named parts of the control section use a cation- exchange activity class, the class associated with the particle- size class that has the most clay is named. For example, in a pedon with a classification of fine-loamy over clayey, mixed, active, calcareous, thermic Typic Udorthent, the cation- exchange activity class \"active\" is associated with the clayey, lower part of the control section. For other soils with strongly contrasting particle-size classes, where one named part of the control section uses a cation-exchange activity class and one named part does not, the class is associated with the part which requires usage. For example, in a pedon with a classification of coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvent, the cation-exchange activity class \"superactive\" is associated with the coarse-loamy, upper part of the control section."

The cracks permit rapid movement of water through the soils, either vertically or laterally. Such soils may have the same texture, mineralogy, and other family properties as soils that do not form cracks or that have cracks that open and close depending on the season.

The criteria most commonly used include presence of, depth to, thickness of, and expression of horizons and properties diagnostic for the higher categories and differences in texture, mineralogy, soil moisture, soil temperature, and amounts of organic matter.
